I think we better talk this over<br />
Maybe when we both get sober<br />
You'll understand I'm only a man<br />
Doing the best that I can.<br />
<br />
This situation can only get rougher<br />
Why should we needlesly suffer ?<br />
Let's call it a day go our own different way<br />
Before we decay.<br />
<br />
You don't have to be afraid of looking into my face<br />
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.<br />
<br />
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling<br />
You have been two-faced, you been double-dealing<br />
I took a chance, got caught in the trance<br />
Of a downhill dance.<br />
<br />
Oh child, why you wanna hurt me ?<br />
I'm exiled you can't convert me<br />
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways<br />
With both eyes glazed.<br />
<br>
<br />
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone<br />
Somewhere in the univers there's a place that you can call home.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow<br />
If I have to beg, steal or borrow<br />
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half<br />
Look at each other and laugh.<br />
<br />
But I don't think it's liable to happen<br />
Like the sound of one hand clapping<br />
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept<br />
Beneath the bed where we slept.<br />
Don't think of me and fantasize of what we never had<br />
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad<br />
Why should we got on watching each other through a telescope ?<br />
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.<br />
<br />
Oh babe, time for a new transition<br />
I wish I was a magician<br />
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond<br />
That we've both gone beyond.</p>
