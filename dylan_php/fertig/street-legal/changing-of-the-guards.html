Sixteen years<br />
Sixteen banners united over the field<br />
Where the good shepherd grieves<br />
Desperate men, desperate women divided<br />
Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves.<br />
<br />
Fortune calls<br />
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace<br />
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down<br />
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born<br />
On midsummer's eve near the tower.<br />
<br />
The cold-blooded moon<br />
The captain waits above the celebration<br />
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid <br />
Whose ebony face is beyond communication<br />
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.<br />
<br />
They shaved her head<br />
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo<br />
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale<br />
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow<br />
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.<br />
<br />
I stumbled to my feet<br />
<br>
I rode past destruction in the ditches<br />
With the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo<br />
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches<br />
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.<br />
<br />
The palace of mirrors<br />
Where dog soldiers are reflected<br />
The endless road and the wailing of chimes<br />
The empty rooms where her memory is protected<br />
Where the angel's voices whisper to the souls of previous times.<br />
<br />
She wakes him up<br />
Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking<br />
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks<br />
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking<br />
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.<br />
Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes<br />
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards<br />
But Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination<br />
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.<br />
<br />
Peace will come<br />
With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire<br />
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall<br />
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating<br />
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.</p>
