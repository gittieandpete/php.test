There's a long distance train rolling through the rain, tears on the letter I write<br />
There's a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much but she's drifting <br />
like a satelite<br />
There's a neon light ablaze in the green smoky haze, and laughter down on<br />
Elizabeth Street<br />
And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone where she bathed<br />
in a stream of pure heat<br />
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise but he practiced <br />
what he preached from the heart<br />
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me the time and the place it <br />
would start.<br />
<br />
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage<br />
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage<br />
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page<br />
Of a book that nobody write<br />
Oh, where are you tonight ?<br />
<br />
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure, to live it you have to explode<br />
In the last hour of need, we entirely agreed, sacrifice was the code of the road<br />
I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John, strong men betitled by doubt<br />
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were but she had some way of finding <br />
them out<br />
He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same, she was waiting putting <br />
flowers on the shelf<br />
<br>
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair and discovered her invisible self.<br />
<br />
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped<br />
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped<br />
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape<br />
I won't but then again, maybe I might<br />
Oh, if I could just find you tonight.<br />
I fought with ny twin, that enemy within, 'til both of us fell by the way<br />
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees while the law looks the other way<br />
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes, the man you were loving <br />
couldn't never get clean<br />
It felt outa place, my foot in his face, but he should-a stayed where his money <br />
was green<br />
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit with the juice running down my leg<br />
Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss and who always was too <br />
proud to beg<br />
There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room and a pathway that <br />
leads up to the stars<br />
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise, just remind me to show <br />
you the scars.<br />
<br />
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived<br />
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived<br />
I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive<br />
But without you it just doesn't seem right<br />
Oh, where are you tonight ?</p>
