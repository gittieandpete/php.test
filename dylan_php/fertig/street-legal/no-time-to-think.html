In death you face life with a child and a wife<br />
Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls<br />
You're soldier of mercy, you're cold and you curse<br />
He who cannot be trusted must fall.<br />
<br />
Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety<br />
You fight for the throne and you travel alone<br />
Unknown as you slowly sink<br />
And there's no time to think.<br />
<br />
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity<br />
For secret, for pieces of change<br />
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you<br />
And it makes you feel violent and strange.<br />
<br />
Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy<br />
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss<br />
In the valley of the missing link<br />
And you have no time to think.<br />
<br />
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you<br />
Her worst is better than best<br />
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes<br />
And I feel so depressed.<br />
<br />
China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality<br />
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you<br />
Like the plague, with a dangerous wink<br />
And there's no time to think.<br />
<br />
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you<br />
Where the lion lies down with the lamb<br />
I'd have paid off the traitor and killed him much later<br />
But that's just the way that I am.<br />
<br />
Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality<br />
But the magician is quicker and his game<br />
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink<br />
And there's no time to think.<br />
<br />
Anger and jealousy's all that he sells us<br />
He's content when you're under his thumb<br />
Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him<br />
To survive it you play deaf and dumb.<br />
<br>
Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity<br />
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes starring clear<br />
At the back of you head as you drink<br />
And there's no time to think.<br />
<br />
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow<br />
Will offer their heads for a prayer<br />
You can't find no salvation, you have no expectations<br />
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere.<br />
<br />
Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility<br />
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper<br />
That is leading your onto the brink<br />
But there's no time to think.<br />
<br />
You've murdered your vanity, buried your sanity<br />
For pleasure you must now resist<br />
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you<br />
They're not even sure you exist.<br />
<br />
Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism<br />
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws<br />
And the sound of the keys as they clink<br />
But there's no time to think.<br />
<br />
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon<br />
With the rose in her hair<br />
Starlight in the East you're finally released<br />
You're stranded but with nothing to share.<br />
<br />
Loyality, unity, epitome, rigidity<br />
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille<br />
'Neath the moon shining bloody and pink<br />
And there's no time to think.<br />
<br />
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you<br />
But no, you will not be deceived<br />
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt<br />
You can give but you cannot receive.<br />
<br />
No time to choose when the truth must die<br />
No time to lose or say goodbye<br />
No time to prepare for the victim that's there<br />
No time to suffer or blink<br />
And no time to think.</p>
