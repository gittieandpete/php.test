Do your love me, or are you just extending goodwill ?<br />
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt ?<br />
I've been burned before and I know the score<br />
So you won't hear me complain<br />
Will I be able to count on you<br />
Or is you love in vain ?<br />
<br />
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude ?<br />
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude ?<br />
Do you know my world, do you know my kind<br />
Or must I explain ?<br />
Will you let me be myself<br />
Or is you love in vain ?<br />
<br />
Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind<br />
<br>
I've been in and out of happiness<br />
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings<br />
And I've never been too impressed.<br />
<br />
All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you<br />
If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too<br />
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow<br />
Do you understand my pain ?<br />
Are you willing to risk it all<br />
Or is you love in vain ?<br />
<br />
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow<br />
Do you understand my pain ?<br />
Are you willing to risk it all<br />
Or is you love in vain ?</p>
