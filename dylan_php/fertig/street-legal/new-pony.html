I had a pony, her name was Lucifer<br />
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer<br />
She broke a leg and needed shooting<br />
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with me back<br />
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with me back<br />
You know she got such a sweet disposition<br />
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.<br />
<br />
I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace<br />
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot lope and pace<br />
<br>
She got great big hind legs<br />
And long black shaggy hair hanging in her face.<br />
<br />
Everybody say you're using voodoo, your feet walk by themselves <br />
Well, everybody say you're using voodoo, I seen your feet walk by themselves <br />
Oh baby, that god you been praying to<br />
Is gonna give ya back what you're wishing on someone else.<br />
<br />
Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you <br />
Well, come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you <br />
Well, you're so nasty and you're so bad<br />
But I swear I love you, yes I do.</p>
