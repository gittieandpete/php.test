Senor, senor, can you tell me where we're headin ?<br />
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon ?<br />
Seems like I been down this way before<br />
Is there any truth in that, senor ?<br />
<br />
Senor, senor, do you know where she is hidin' ?<br />
How long are we gonna be riding ?<br />
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door ?<br />
Will there be any comfort there senor ?<br />
<br />
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck<br />
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck<br />
There's a marcing band still playing in that vacant lot<br />
Where's she held me in her arms one time and said, Forget me not.<br />
<br />
Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon<br />
Smell the tail of the dragon<br />
<br>
Can't stand the suspense anymore<br />
Can you tell me who to contact here, senor ?<br />
<br />
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled<br />
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field<br />
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring<br />
He said, Son, this ain't a dream no more it's the real thing.<br />
<br />
Senor, senor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather<br />
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together<br />
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor<br />
I'm ready when you are, senor.<br />
<br />
Senor, senor, let's overturn these cables<br />
Disconnect these tables<br />
This place don't make sense to me no more<br />
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor ?</p>
