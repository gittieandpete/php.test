I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes<br />
When she's near me she's so hard to recognize<br />
But I finally realize there's no room for regret<br />
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.<br />
<br />
Hold me, baby be near<br />
You told me that you'd be sincere<br />
But every day of the year's like playing Russian roulette<br />
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.<br />
<br />
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen<br />
I saw you in the wilderness among the men<br />
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again<br />
All you got to do is wait 'till I'll tell you when.<br />
<br />
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell<br />
<br>
You're a hard worker, baby, and I know you well<br />
At this weekend in hell is making me sweat<br />
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.<br />
<br />
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen<br />
I saw you in the wilderness among the men<br />
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again<br />
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.<br />
<br />
You belong to me baby, without any doubt<br />
Don't forsake me baby, don't sell me out<br />
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet<br />
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.<br />
<br />
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.<br />
True love, true love, true love tends to forget<br />
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.</p>
