You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe<br />
But you're back were you belong<br />
Go get me my pistol, babe<br />
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.<br />
<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying<br />
You know, I know the sun will always shine<br />
So baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.<br />
<br />
Go down to the river, babe<br />
Honey, I will meet you there<br />
Go down to the river, babe<br />
Honey, I will pay your fare.<br />
<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying<br />
You know, I know the sun will always shine<br />
So baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.<br />
<br>
<br />
If you're looking for assistance, babe<br />
Or if you just want some company<br />
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to<br />
Honey, come and see about me.<br />
<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying<br />
You know, I know the sun will always shine<br />
So baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.<br />
<br />
You been hurt so many times<br />
And I know what you're thinking of<br />
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe<br />
To see that you're madly in love.<br />
<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying<br />
You know, I know the sun will always shine<br />
So baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.</p>
