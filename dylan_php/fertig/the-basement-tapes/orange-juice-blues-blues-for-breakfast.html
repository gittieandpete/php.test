(by richard manuel.)<br />
<br />
I had a hard time waking this morning<br />
I got a lotta things on my mind<br />
Like those friends of yours<br />
They keep bringing me down<br />
Just hangin' round all the time<br />
<br />
I've had a hard time waking most mornings<br />
And it's been that way for a month or more<br />
You've had things your way<br />
But now i've got to say<br />
I'm on my way out the door<br />
<br />
Chorus:<br />
<br>
Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby<br />
You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?<br />
Try and get right, baby, don't you remember how it used to be?<br />
<br />
You had a hard time waking this morning<br />
And i can see it in your empty eyes<br />
But there's no need for talking<br />
Or walking round the block<br />
Just to figure out the reason why<br />
<br />
I have a hard time handing out warnings<br />
I'll just slide on out the door<br />
Cuz i'm tired of everything<br />
Being beautiful, beautiful<br />
And i ain't coming back no more<br />
