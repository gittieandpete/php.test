Well, that big dump blonde <br />
With her wheel in the gorge<br />
Turtle, that friend of theirs <br />
With his checks all forged<br />
And his cheeks in a chunk <br />
With his cheese in the cash<br />
They're all gonna be there <br />
At that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
It's that million dollar bash.<br />
<br />
Everybody from right now <br />
Go ever there and back<br />
The louder they come <br />
The bigger they crack<br />
Come now, sweet cream <br />
Don't forget to flash<br />
We're all gonna meet <br />
At that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
It's that million dollar bash.<br />
<br />
Well, I took my counselor <br />
Out to the barn<br />
Silly Nelly was there <br />
She told me a yarn<br />
Then along came Jones <br />
<br>
Emptied the trash<br />
Everybody went down <br />
To that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
It's that million dollar bash.<br />
Well, I'm hittin' it too hard <br />
My stones won't take<br />
I'm get up in the mornin' <br />
But it's too early to wake<br />
First it's hello, goodbye <br />
Then push and then crash<br />
But we're all gonna make it <br />
At that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
It's that million dollar bash.<br />
<br />
Well, I looked at my watch <br />
I looked at my wrist<br />
Punched myself in the face <br />
With my fist<br />
I took my potatoes <br />
Down to be mashed<br />
Then I made it over to <br />
That million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee <br />
It's that million dollar bash.</p>
