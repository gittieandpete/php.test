<br />
<br />
Bessie was more than just a friend of mine<br />
We shared the good times with the bad<br />
Now many a year has passed me by<br />
I still recall the best thing i ever had<br />
<br />
I'm just goin' down the road t' see bessie<br />
Oh, see her soon<br />
Goin' down the road t' see bessie smith<br />
When i get there i wonder what she'll do<br />
<br />
Now all the crazy things i had to try<br />
Well i tried them all and then some<br />
But if you're lucky one day you find out<br />
Where it is you're really comin' from<br />
<br />
I'm just goin' down the road t' see bessie<br />
Oh, see her soon<br />
Goin' down the road t' see bessie smith<br />
When i get there i wonder what she'll do<br />
<br />
Now in my day i've made some foolish moves<br />
<br>
But back then, i didn't worry 'bout a thing<br />
And now again i still wonder to myself<br />
Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing<br />
<br />
I'm just goin' down the road t' see bessie<br />
Oh, see her soon<br />
Goin' down the road t' see bessie smith<br />
When i get there i wonder what she'll do<br />
<br />
There's so much time has gone right on by<br />
I didn't think one could be so wrong<br />
And then one night i was drinkin' and a-thinkin'<br />
In the bottom of the glass i could see bessie's face so strong<br />
<br />
I'm just goin' down the road t' see bessie<br />
Oh, see her soon<br />
Goin' down the road t' see bessie smith<br />
When i get there i wonder what she'll do<br />
<br />
When she sees me will she know what i've been through?<br />
Will old times start to feelin' like new?<br />
When i get there will our love still feel so true?<br />
Yet all i have, i'll be a-bringin' it to you<br />
Oh bessie, sing them old-time blues<br />
