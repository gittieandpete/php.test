After a while we took in the clothes,<br />
Nobody said very much.<br />
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants<br />
Which nobody really wanted to touch.<br />
Mama come in and picked up a book<br />
An' papa asked her what it was.<br />
Someone else asked, &quot;what do you care?&quot;<br />
Papa said, &quot;well, just because.&quot;<br />
Then they started to take back their clothes,<br />
Hang 'em on the line.<br />
It was january the thirtieth<br />
And everybody was feelin' fine.<br />
<br />
The next day everybody got up<br />
Seein' if the clothes were dry.<br />
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,<br />
Mama, of course, she said, &quot;hi!&quot;<br />
&quot;have you heard the news?&quot; he said, with a grin,<br />
&quot;the vice-president's gone mad!&quot;<br />
<br>
&quot;where?&quot; &quot;downtown.&quot; &quot;when?&quot; &quot;last night.&quot;<br />
&quot;hmm, say, that's too bad!&quot;<br />
&quot;well, there's nothin' we can do about it,&quot; said the neighbor,<br />
&quot;it's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget.&quot;<br />
&quot;yes, i guess so,&quot; said ma,<br />
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.<br />
<br />
I reached up, touched my shirt,<br />
And the neighbor said, &quot;are those clothes yours?&quot;<br />
I said, &quot;some of 'em, not all of 'em.&quot;<br />
He said, &quot;ya always help out around here with the chores?&quot;<br />
I said, &quot;sometime, not all the time.&quot;<br />
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose<br />
Just as papa yelled outside,<br />
&quot;mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.&quot;<br />
Well, i just do what i'm told,<br />
So, i did it, of course.<br />
I went back in the house and mama met me<br />
And then i shut all the doors.<br />
