We carried you in our arms <br />
On Independence Day<br />
And now you'd throw us all aside <br />
And put us on our way<br />
Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun <br />
Would treat a father so<br />
To wait upon him hand and foot <br />
And always tell him "No?"<br />
Tears of rage, tears of grief <br />
Why am I the one who must be the thief ?<br />
Come to me now, you know <br />
We're so alone <br />
And life is brief.<br />
<br />
We pointed out the way to go <br />
And scratched your name in sand<br />
Though you just thought that it was nothing more <br />
Than a place for you to stand<br />
Now I want you to know that while you watched <br />
You discover there was no one true<br />
<br>
Must everybody really thought <br />
It was a childish thing to do<br />
Tears of rage, tears of grief <br />
Why am I the one who must be the thief ?<br />
Come to me now, you know <br />
We're so alone <br />
And life is brief.<br />
<br />
It was all very painless <br />
When you went out to receive<br />
All that false instruction <br />
Which we never could believe<br />
And now the heart is filled with gold <br />
As if it was a purse<br />
But oh, what kind of love is this <br />
Which goes from bad to worse ?<br />
Tears of rage, tears of grief <br />
Why am I the one who must be the thief ?<br />
Come to me now, you know <br />
We're so alone <br />
And life is brief.</p>
