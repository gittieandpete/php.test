Ain't no more cane on the brazos<br />
Oh, oh, oh, oh...<br />
Its all been ground down to molasses<br />
Oh, oh- oh, oh- oh...<br />
<br />
You shoulda been on the river in 1910<br />
They were driving the women just like they drove the men.<br />
<br />
Go down old hannah, don'cha rise no more<br />
Don't you rise up til judgment day's for sure<br />
<br />
<br>
Ain't no more cane on the brazos<br />
Its all been ground down to molasses<br />
<br />
Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old shine<br />
Well ya drove that bully til he went stone blind<br />
<br />
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head<br />
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead<br />
<br />
Ain't no more cane on the brazos<br />
Its all been ground down to molasses.<br />
