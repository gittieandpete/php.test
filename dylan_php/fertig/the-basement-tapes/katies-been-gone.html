<br />
Katie's been gone since the spring time;<br />
She wrote one time'n sent her love.<br />
Katie's been gone for such a long time now.<br />
I wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of.<br />
<br />
Dear katie,<br />
If you can hear me,<br />
I can't wait to have ya near me.<br />
<br />
Oh, katie, since ya caught that bus,<br />
Well, i just don't know how things are with us.<br />
I'm still here and you're out there.<br />
<br />
Katie laughed when i said i was lonely.<br />
She said, there's no need t'feel that way.<br />
Katie said that i was her only one,<br />
But then i wonder why she didn't wanna stay.<br />
<br />
Dear katie, if i'm the only one,<br />
How much longer will you be gone?<br />
Oh, katie, won't ya tell me straight:<br />
How much longer do i have to wait?<br />
<br>
<br />
I'll believe you,<br />
But please come through.<br />
I know it's wrong to be apart this long;<br />
You should be here, near me.<br />
<br />
Katie's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind.<br />
She's gone to find some newer places,<br />
Left the old life far behind.<br />
Dear katie, dont ya miss your home?<br />
I dont see why you had to roam.<br />
<br />
Dear katie, since you've been away<br />
I lose a little something every day<br />
I need you here, but you're still out there.<br />
Dear katie, please drop me a line,<br />
Just write, love, to tell me you're fine.<br />
<br />
Oh, katie, if you can hear me,<br />
I just cant wait to have you near me.<br />
I can only think<br />
Where are you,<br />
What ya do, may be there's someone new.<br />
