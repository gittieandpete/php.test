Long-distance operator<br />
Place this call, it's not for fun<br />
Long-distance operator<br />
Please place this call, you know it's not for fun<br />
I gotta get a message to my baby<br />
You know, she's not just anyone There are thousands in the phone booth<br />
Thousands at the gate<br />
There are thousands in the phone booth<br />
<br>
Thousands at the gate<br />
Everybody wants to make a long-distance call<br />
But you know they're just gonna have to wait Everybody wants to be my friend<br />
But nobody wants to get higher<br />
Everybody wants to be my friend<br />
But nobody wants to get higher<br />
Long-distance operator<br />
I believe I'm stranglin' in this telephone wire</p>
