Now, there's a certain thing<br />
That i learned from jim<br />
That he'd always make sure i'd understand<br />
And that is that there's a certain way<br />
That a man must swim<br />
If he expects to live off<br />
Of the fat of the land.<br />
Open the door, homer,<br />
I've heard it said before.<br />
Open the door, homer,<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
But i ain't gonna hear it said no more.<br />
<br />
Now, there's a certain thing<br />
That i learned from my friend, mouse<br />
A fella who always blushes<br />
And that is that ev'ryone<br />
Must always flush out his house<br />
If he don't expect to be<br />
<br>
Goin' 'round housing flushes.<br />
Open the door, homer,<br />
I've heard it said before.<br />
Open the door, homer,<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
But i ain't gonna hear it said no more.<br />
<br />
&quot;take care of all your memories&quot;<br />
Said my friend, mick<br />
&quot;for you cannot relive them<br />
And remember when you're out there<br />
Tryin' to heal the sick<br />
That you must always<br />
First forgive them.&quot;<br />
Open the door, homer,<br />
I've heard it said before.<br />
Open the door, homer,<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
But i ain't gonna hear it said no more.<br />
