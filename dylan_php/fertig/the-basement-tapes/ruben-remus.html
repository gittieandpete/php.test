(by j.r. robertson and r. manuel)<br />
<br />
Wrote a letter this mornin',<br />
Put it in your hat,<br />
'cause no one to read it<br />
And i know you knew that.<br />
I bought a joke, a trick or two,<br />
Just to bring and show you,<br />
Caught ya with the trickster too.<br />
Sometimes i wonder how ya knew<br />
A hypnotist, fancytalker,<br />
Ruben remus ain't no doctor<br />
<br />
I knew the man and tried to remember<br />
Just where it was that i'd seen his face.<br />
Long ago, in a movie show,<br />
He was like that man singin' bass.<br />
Knew him by his nurs'ry rhyme:<br />
The story of the rabbit man.<br />
Fell right in and said to him:<br />
&quot;i'd like to help you if i can.&quot;<br />
I know the film would only shock ya,<br />
Ruben remus ain't no doctor!<br />
<br />
<br>
He only needed what you had,<br />
Asked for nothing more,<br />
Said he'd like to take you on,<br />
But it's been done before.<br />
You couldn't see he's a travelin' man<br />
And he cannot take your hand.<br />
It's very hard to understand<br />
Why his songs were never banned.<br />
Guess the man would never knock ya,<br />
Ruben remus ain't no doctor!<br />
<br />
No one seen ya since he's been gone,<br />
It's been a day, maybe more.<br />
I took a walk in your yard<br />
And knocked on your back door.<br />
Why don't you let me in?<br />
I'm not the man who did ya in.<br />
Is mr. remus still your friend?<br />
You say you don't remember him.<br />
Turn me down, would ya?<br />
Well, i've got news for you.<br />
Turn me down would ya,<br />
Can't ya tell<br />
I'm gonna change your mind before i'm... trough...<br />
