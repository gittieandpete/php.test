Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Apple's got your fly.<br />
<br />
I went down to the river on a saturday morn<br />
A-lookin' around just to see who's born<br />
I found a little chicken down on his knees<br />
I went up and yelled to him<br />
"Please, please, please"<br />
He said, "Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Apple's got your fly".<br />
<br />
I went down to the corner at a-half past ten<br />
I's lookin' around, I wouldn't say when<br />
I looked down low, I looked above<br />
And who did I see but the one I love<br />
She said, "Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Don't ya tell Henry<br />
<br>
Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Apple's got your fly".<br />
<br />
Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve<br />
A-lookin' around just to see myself<br />
I spotted a horse and a donkey too<br />
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few<br />
The said, "Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Apple's got your fly".<br />
<br />
Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night<br />
A-lookin around, it was outa sight<br />
I looked high and low for that big ol' tree<br />
I did go upstairs but I didn't see nobody but me<br />
I said, "Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Don't ya tell Henry<br />
Apple's got your fly".</p>
