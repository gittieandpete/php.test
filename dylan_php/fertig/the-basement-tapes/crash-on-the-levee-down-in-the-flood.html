Crash on the levee, mama<br />
Water's gonna overflow<br />
Swamp's gonna rise<br />
No boat's gonna row<br />
Now, you can train on down<br />
To Williams Point<br />
You can bust your feet<br />
You can rock this joint<br />
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now ?<br />
You're gonna have to find yourself<br />
Another best friend, somehow.<br />
<br />
Now, don't you try an' move me<br />
You're just gonna lose<br />
There's a crash on the levee<br />
And mama, you've been refused<br />
Well, it's sugar for sugar<br />
<br>
And salt for salt<br />
If you go down in the flood<br />
It's gonna be your own fault<br />
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now ?<br />
You're gonna have to find yourself<br />
Another best friend, somehow.<br />
<br />
Well, that high tide's risin'<br />
Mama, don't you let me down<br />
Pack up your suitcase<br />
Mama, don't you make a sound<br />
Now, it's king for king<br />
Queen for queen<br />
It's gonna be the meanest flood<br />
That anybody's seen<br />
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now ?<br />
You're gonna have to find yourself<br />
Another best friend, somehow.</p>
