Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus<br />
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed<br />
On the very next day with a nose full of pus<br />
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread<br />
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread<br />
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze too<br />
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're headin' out<br />
For Wichita in a pile of fruit<br />
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout<br />
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout<br />
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle<br />
<br>
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it<br />
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells<br />
Take me down to California, baby<br />
Take me down to California, baby<br />
Take me down to California, baby<br />
Take me down to California, baby Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus<br />
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed<br />
On the very next day with a nose full of pus<br />
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread<br />
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread<br />
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread<br />
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread</p>
