Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah, under that apple suckling tree<br />
Oh yeah ! Underneath that tree, there's just gonna be you and me<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah !<br />
<br />
Old man sailin' in a dinghy boat<br />
Down there<br />
Old man sailin' in a dinghy boat<br />
On there<br />
Gonna pull man down on a suckling hook<br />
Gonna pull man into the suckling brook<br />
Oh yeah !<br />
<br />
Now, he's underneath that apple suckling tree<br />
Oh yeah ! <br />
Under that apple suckling tree<br />
Oh yeah !<br />
That's underneath that tree<br />
<br>
There's gonna be just you and me<br />
Underneath that apple suckling tree.<br />
<br />
I push him back and I stand in line <br />
Oh yeah <br />
Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line <br />
Oh yeah<br />
Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line<br />
I get on board in two-eyed time <br />
Oh yeah !<br />
<br />
Now, who's on the table, who's tell me ? <br />
Oh yeah<br />
Who's on the table, who's tell me ? <br />
Oh yeah<br />
Who should I tell, oh, who should I tell ?<br />
The forty-nine of you like bats out of hell<br />
Oh, underneath that old apple suckling tree.</p>
