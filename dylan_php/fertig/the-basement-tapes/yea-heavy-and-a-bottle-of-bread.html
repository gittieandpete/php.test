Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus<br />
The poor litlle chauffeur, though, she was back in bed <br />
On the very next day with a nose full of pus<br />
Yea ! Heavy and a bottle of bread ! <br />
Yea ! Heavy and a bottle of bread !<br />
Yea ! Heavy and a bottle of bread.<br />
<br />
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze too<br />
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're headin' out <br />
For Wichita in a pile of fruit<br />
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout<br />
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout<br />
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout.<br />
<br>
<br />
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle<br />
Bring my pipe, we're gonna shake it<br />
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells<br />
Take me down to California, baby <br />
Take me down to California, baby<br />
Take me down to California, baby.<br />
<br />
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus<br />
The poor litlle chauffeur, though, she was back in bed <br />
On the very next day with a nose full of pus.<br />
Yea ! Heavy and a bottle of bread ! <br />
Yea ! Heavy and a bottle of bread !<br />
Yea ! Heavy and a bottle of bread.</p>
