<br />
<br />
Stranded out in the night,<br />
Eliza took me down<br />
To see the widow give<br />
Rain to the town.<br />
It's against the law<br />
To be a tonic man,<br />
But the widow knows<br />
She's got the upper hand.<br />
So i went on in<br />
Feelin' kinda wheezy.<br />
You know she soothed my mind, boys,<br />
She rocked me kinda slow and easy<br />
All day and all night.<br />
<br />
Pick a card before you go<br />
It's a long trip to mexico.<br />
<br />
Eliza wait by the door,<br />
I can't stay here anymore, no, no.<br />
<br />
Then she took a pill<br />
She washed her feet in the mud<br />
She said &quot;look out son,<br />
You know, i just ordered a flood<br />
<br>
For forty days and forty nights&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then i dropped my shoes,<br />
Eliza called my name.<br />
She said it looked to her<br />
Like it's gonna rain.<br />
Then the cotton king<br />
Came in chokin'<br />
And the widow laughed and said:<br />
&quot;i ain't jokin'.<br />
Take once for all&quot;<br />
She said &quot;now don't ya tease me.<br />
I just fell in love, boy,<br />
So rock me kinda slow and kinda easy,<br />
All day and all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sweet william said<br />
With a drunken head:<br />
&quot;if i had a boat,<br />
I'd help y'all float&quot;.<br />
Eliza stood there watching,<br />
William in a trance,<br />
As the widow did the st. vitus dance.<br />
But just then an old man<br />
With a boat named &quot;breezy&quot;<br />
Said: &quot;you can ride with clyde, boys,<br />
If you rock it kinda slow and easy,<br />
All day and all night&quot;.<br />
