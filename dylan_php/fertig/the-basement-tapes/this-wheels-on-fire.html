If your mem'ry serves you well<br />
We were goin' to meet again and wait<br />
So I'm goin' to unpack all my things<br />
And sit before it gets too late<br />
No man alive will come to you<br />
With another tale to tell<br />
And you know that we shall meet again<br />
If your mem'ry serves you well<br />
This wheel's on fire<br />
Rolling down the road<br />
Best notify my next of kin<br />
This wheel shall explode !<br />
<br />
If your mem'ry serves you well<br />
I was goin' to confiscate your lace<br />
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot<br />
And hide it in your case<br />
If I knew for sure that it was yours ...<br />
But it was oh so hard to tell<br />
<br>
And you knew that we would meet again<br />
If your mem'ry serves you well<br />
This wheel's on fire<br />
Rolling down the road<br />
Best notify my next of kin<br />
This wheel shall explode !<br />
<br />
If your mem'ry serves you well<br />
You'll remember you're the one<br />
That called on me to call on them<br />
To get you your favors done<br />
And after ev'ry plan had failed<br />
And there was nothing more to tell<br />
You knew that we would meet again<br />
If your mem'ry serves you well<br />
This wheel's on fire<br />
Rolling down the road<br />
Best notify my next of kin<br />
This wheel shall explode !</p>
