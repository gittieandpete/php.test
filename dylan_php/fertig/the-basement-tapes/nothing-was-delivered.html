Nothing was delivered<br />
And I tell this truth to you<br />
Not out of spite or anger<br />
But simply because it's true<br />
Now, I hope you won't object to this<br />
Giving back all what you owe<br />
The fewer words you have to waste on this<br />
The sooner you can go.<br />
<br />
Nothing is better, nothing is best<br />
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.<br />
<br />
Nothing was delivered<br />
But I can't say I sympathize<br />
With what your fate is going to be<br />
Yes, for telling all those lies<br />
Now you must provide some answers<br />
For what you sold has not been received<br />
And the sooner you come up with them<br />
The sooner you can leave.<br />
<br />
Nothing is better, nothing is best<br />
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.<br />
<br />
Now you know<br />
Nothing was delivered<br />
And it's up to you to say<br />
Just what you had in mind<br />
When you made ev'rybody pay<br />
No, nothing was delivered<br />
Yes, 'n' someone must explain<br />
That as long as it takes to do this<br />
Then that's how long that you'll remain<br />
Nothing is better, nothing is best<br />
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.<br />
Open The Door, Homer<br />
<br />
<br>
Now, there's a certain thing<br />
That I learned from Jim<br />
That he's always make sure I'd understand<br />
And that is that there's a certain way<br />
That a man must swim<br />
If he expects to live off<br />
Of the fat of the land<br />
Open the door, Homer<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
Open the door, Homer<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.<br />
<br />
Now, there's a certain thing<br />
That I learned from my friend, Mouse<br />
A fella who never blushes in<br />
And that is that ev'ryone<br />
Must always flush out his house<br />
If he don't expect to be<br />
Goin' 'round housing flushes<br />
Open the door, Homer<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
Open the door, Homer<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.<br />
<br />
"Take care of all your memories"<br />
Said my friend, Mick<br />
"For you can not relive them<br />
And remember when you're out there<br />
Tryin' to heal the sick<br />
That you must always<br />
First forgive them"<br />
Open the door, Homer<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
Open the door, Homer<br />
I've heard it said before<br />
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.</p>
