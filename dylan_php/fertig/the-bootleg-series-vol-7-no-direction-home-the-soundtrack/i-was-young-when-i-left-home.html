I was young when I left home,<br />
And I been out a'ramblin' 'round,<br />
And I never wrote a letter to my home.<br />
To my home, Lord, to my home,<br />
And I never wrote a letter to my home.<br />
<br />
It was just the other day<br />
I was drinkin' on my pay<br />
When I met an old friend I used to know.<br />
He said your mother's dead and gone,<br />
Your baby sister's all gone wrong,<br />
And your daddy needs you home right away.<br />
<br />
Not a shirt on my back,<br />
Not a penny on my name.<br />
Well I can't go home this a'way.<br />
This a'way, Lord Lord Lord,<br />
I can't go home this a'way.<br />
<br />
If you miss the train I'm on,<br />
Count the days I'm gone,<br />
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.<br />
A hundred miles, a hundred, baby,<br />
Lord Lord Lord,<br />
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.<br />
<br />
<br>
When I's playin' on the track,<br />
Maw would come and whip me back,<br />
On them tressles down by ol' Jim McKay's.<br />
<br />
When I pay the debt I owe<br />
To the commissary store,<br />
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.<br />
Oh home, Lord Lord Lord,<br />
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.<br />
<br />
I used to tell my Maw sometimes,<br />
When I see them ridin' blinds,<br />
Gonna make me a home out in the wind.<br />
In the wind, Lord, in the wind,<br />
Make me a home out in the wind.<br />
<br />
I don't like it in the wind,<br />
I want to go back home again,<br />
But I can't go home this a'way.<br />
This a'way, Lord Lord Lord,<br />
And I can't go home this a'way.<br />
<br />
I was young when I left home,<br />
And I been all a' ramblin' 'round,<br />
And I never wrote a letter to my home.<br />
To my home, Lord Lord Lord,<br />
And I never wrote a letter to my home.</p>
