[Verse 1]<br />
I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler<br />
I'm a long way from my home<br />
If the people don't like me<br />
They can leave me alone<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Come sit down beside me<br />
Come sit down right here<br />
Come sit down, love, I want you<br />
Love you boldly, so dear<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
When you get to Wyoming<br />
A letter you'll see<br />
If you get into trouble<br />
Just you write and tell me<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
For I once had a lover<br />
Her age was sixteen<br />
She's a flower of velvet and the rose of Celine<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Her parents was against me<br />
Now she is the same<br />
If I write on your book, love<br />
Just you blot out my name<br />
<br />
[Outro]<br />
Oh there's changes in the ocean<br />
There's changes in the sea<br />
There's changes in my true love<br />
There's no change in me</p>
