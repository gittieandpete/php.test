This land is your land, this land is my land<br />
From the California to the New York Island<br />
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
As I went walking that ribbon of highway<br />
I saw above me that endless skyway<br />
Saw below me the golden valley<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps<br />
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts<br />
All around me a voice was sounding<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br>
<br />
When the sun come shining, then I was strolling<br />
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling<br />
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
This land is your land, this land is my land<br />
From the California to the New York Island<br />
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
When the sun come shining, then I was strolling<br />
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling<br />
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>
