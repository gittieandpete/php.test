I used to dream about angels But then I never knew<br />
That I'd ever meet one And such a sweet one<br />
Till I met you<br />
<br />
When did you leave heaven? How could they let you go?<br />
How's ev'ry thing in Heaven? I'd like to know<br />
Why did you trade Heaven for all these earthly things<br />
Where di you hide your Halo?<br />
<br />
Where did you lose your wings?<br />
Have they missed you?<br />
Can you get back in?<br />
<br />
If Ikissed you would it be a sin?<br />
<br>
I amonly human but you are so divine<br />
When did you leave Heave, angel mine?<br />
<br />
When did you leave heaven? How could they let you go?<br />
How's ev'ry thing in Heaven? I'd like to know<br />
Why did you trade Heaven for all these earthly things<br />
Where di you hide your Halo?<br />
<br />
Where did you lose your wings?<br />
Have they missed you?<br />
Can you get back in?<br />
<br />
If Ikissed you would it be a sin?<br />
I amonly human but you are so divine<br />
When did you leave Heave, angel mine?</p>
