Christmas makes you feel emotional<br />
It may bring parties or thoughts devotional<br />
Whatever happens or what may be,<br />
Here is what Christmas time means to me.<br />
<br />
City sidewalk, busy sidewalks<br />
Dressed in holiday style.<br />
In the air there's<br />
A feeling of Christmas.<br />
<br />
Children laughing, people passing,<br />
Meeting smile after smile,<br />
And on every street corner you'll hear:<br />
<br />
Silver bells, silver bells,<br />
It's Christmas time in the city.<br />
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,<br />
<br>
Soon it will be Christmas day.<br />
<br />
City street lights,<br />
Even stop lights,<br />
Blink a bright red and green,<br />
As the shoppers rush home<br />
With their treasures.<br />
<br />
Hear the snow crunch,<br />
See the kids bunch,<br />
This is Santa's big scene,<br />
And above all this bustle you'll hear:<br />
<br />
Silver bells, silver bells,<br />
It's Christmas time in the city.<br />
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,<br />
Soon it will be Christmas day.</p>
