The first Noel the angels did say<br />
Was to certain poor shepherds<br />
In fields as they lay,<br />
In fields where they lay<br />
Keeping their sheep<br />
On a cold winter's night<br />
That was so deep.<br />
Noel Noel Noel Noel!<br />
Born is the King of Israel!<br />
<br />
They looked up and saw a star<br />
Shining in the East beyond them far,<br />
And to the earth it gave great light,<br />
And so it continued both day and night.<br />
Noel Noel Noel Noel!<br />
Born is the King of Israel!<br />
<br />
And by the light of that same star<br />
Three wise men came from country far,<br />
To seek for a King was their intent<br />
And to follow the star<br />
Wherever it went.<br />
Noel Noel Noel Noel!<br />
Born is the King of Israel!<br />
<br />
This star drew nigh to the northwest<br />
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,<br />
<br>
And there it did both stop and stay<br />
Right over the place where Jesus lay.<br />
Noel Noel Noel Noel!<br />
Born is the King of Israel!<br />
<br />
Then did they know assuredly<br />
Within that house the King did lie:<br />
One entered in then for to see,<br />
And found the Babe in poverty:<br />
Noel Noel Noel Noel!<br />
Born is the King of Israel!<br />
<br />
Then entered in those wise men three<br />
Full reverently upon their knee,<br />
And offered there in His presence<br />
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense.<br />
Noel Noel Noel Noel!<br />
Born is the King of Israel!<br />
<br />
Then let us all with one accord<br />
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,<br />
That hath made heaven<br />
And earth of naught<br />
And with His blood<br />
Mankind hath bought.<br />
Noel Noel Noel Noel!<br />
Born is the King of Israel!</p>
