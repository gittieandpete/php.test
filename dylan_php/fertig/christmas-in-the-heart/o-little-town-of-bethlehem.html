O little town of Bethlehem,<br />
How still we see thee lie.<br />
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep<br />
The silent stars go by;<br />
Yet in thy dark streets shineth<br />
The everlasting Light;<br />
The hopes and fears of all the years<br />
Are met in thee tonight.<br />
<br />
For Christ is born of Mary,<br />
And, gathered all above<br />
While mortals sleep, the angels keep<br />
Their watch of wondering love.<br />
O morning stars, together<br />
Proclaim the holy birth.<br />
And praises sing to God the King.<br />
And peace to men on earth.<br />
<br />
How silently, how silently<br />
The wondrous gift is given!<br />
So God imparts to human hearts<br />
The blessings of His heaven.<br />
<br>
No ear may hear His coming;<br />
But in this world of sin,<br />
Where meek souls will receive Him,<br />
Still The dear Christ enters in.<br />
<br />
Where children, pure and happy,<br />
Pray to the Blessed Child;<br />
Where misery cries out to thee,<br />
Son of the Mother mild;<br />
Where charity stands watching,<br />
And faith holds wide the door,<br />
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,<br />
And Christmas comes once more.<br />
<br />
O Holy Child of Bethlehem,<br />
Descend to us, we pray;<br />
Cast out our sin and enter in;<br />
Be born in us today!<br />
We hear the Christmas angels<br />
The great glad tidings tell;<br />
O come to us, abide with us,<br />
Our Lord Emmanuel!</p>
