All through the year<br />
We've waited<br />
Waited through spring and fall<br />
<br />
To hear silver bells ringing<br />
See winter time bringing<br />
The happiest season of all<br />
<br />
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire<br />
Jack Frost nipping at your nose<br />
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir<br />
And folks dressed up like Eskimos<br />
<br />
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe<br />
Help to make the season bright<br />
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow<br />
Will find it hard to sleep tonight<br />
<br />
<br>
They know that Santa's on his way<br />
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies<br />
On his sleigh<br />
And ev'ry mother's<br />
Child is gonna spy to see if<br />
Reindeer really know how to fly<br />
<br />
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase<br />
To kids from one to ninety-two<br />
Altho' it's been said<br />
Many times many ways<br />
Merry Christmas to you<br />
<br />
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase<br />
