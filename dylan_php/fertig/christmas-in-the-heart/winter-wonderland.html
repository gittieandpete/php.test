wonderland<br />
winter wonderland<br />
wonderland<br />
<br />
Sleigh bells ring<br />
Are you listening?<br />
In the lane<br />
Snow is glistening<br />
A beautiful sight<br />
We're happy tonight<br />
Walking<br />
In a winter wonderland<br />
<br />
Gone away<br />
Is the bluebird<br />
In his place<br />
Is a new bird<br />
He sings a love song<br />
As we go along<br />
Walking<br />
In a winter wonderland<br />
<br />
In the meadow<br />
We can build a snowman<br />
And pretend<br />
That he is Parson Brown<br />
He'll say are you married?<br />
<br>
We'll say no man<br />
But you can do the job<br />
When you're in town<br />
<br />
Later on, we'll conspire<br />
As we dream, by the fire<br />
To face unafraid<br />
The plans that we've made<br />
Walking<br />
In a winter wonderland<br />
<br />
In the meadow<br />
We can build a snowman<br />
And pretend<br />
That he's a circus clown<br />
We'll have lots of fun<br />
With Mr. Snowman<br />
Until the other kids<br />
'ill knock him down<br />
<br />
When it's cold<br />
Ain't it thrilling<br />
When your nose<br />
Gets to chilling<br />
We'll frolic and play<br />
The Eskimo way<br />
Walking<br />
In a winter wonderland</p>
