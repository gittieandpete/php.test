The jingle bells are jingling<br />
The streets are white with snow<br />
The happy crowds are mingling<br />
But there's no one that I know<br />
<br />
I'm sure that you'll forgive me<br />
If I don't enthuse<br />
I guess I've got the Christmas blues<br />
<br />
I've done my window shopping<br />
There's not a store I've missed<br />
But what's the use of stopping<br />
When there's no one on your list<br />
<br />
You'll know the way I'm feeling<br />
When you love and you lose<br />
I guess I've got the Christmas blues<br />
<br />
When somebody wants you<br />
Somebody needs you<br />
<br>
Christmas is a joy of joy<br />
But friends, when you're lonely<br />
You'll find that it's only<br />
A thing for little girls and little boys<br />
<br />
May all your days be merry<br />
Your seasons full of cheer<br />
But till it's January<br />
I'll just go and disappear<br />
<br />
Old Santa may have brought you<br />
Some stars for your shoes<br />
But Santa only brought me the blues<br />
Those brightly packaged<br />
Tinsel covered Christmas blues<br />
<br />
Old Santa may have brought you<br />
Some stars for your shoes<br />
But Santa only brought me the blues<br />
Those brightly packaged<br />
Tinsel covered Christmas blues</p>
