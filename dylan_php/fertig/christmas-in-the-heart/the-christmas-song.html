Chestnuts roasting on an open fire <br />
Jack Frost nipping at your nose <br />
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir <br />
And folks dressed up like Eskimos <br />
<br />
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe <br />
Will help to make the season bright <br />
And tiny tots with their eyes all aglow <br />
Will find it hard to sleep tonight <br />
<br />
They know that Santa is on his way <br />
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <br />
And every mother's child is gonna spy <br />
To see if reindeer really know how to fly <br />
<br />
And so I'm offering this simple phrase <br />
<br>
To kids from 1 to 92 <br />
Though it's been said many times, many ways <br />
Merry Christmas to you <br />
<br />
They know that Santa is on his way, he's on his way <br />
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <br />
And every mother's child is going to spy <br />
To see if reindeer really know how to fly <br />
<br />
And so I'm offering this simple phrase <br />
To kids from 1 to 92 <br />
Although it's been said many times, many ways <br />
Merry Christmas, yeah, merry Christmas <br />
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas to you <br />
<br />
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas <br />
Merry Christmas</p>
