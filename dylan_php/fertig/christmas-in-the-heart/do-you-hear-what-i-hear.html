Said the night wind to the little lamb <br />
"Do you see what I see? <br />
Way up in the sky, little lamb <br />
Do you see what I see? <br />
A star, a star, dancing in the night <br />
With a tail as big as a kite <br />
With a tail as big as a kite" <br />
<br />
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy <br />
"Do you hear what I hear? <br />
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy <br />
Do you hear what I hear? <br />
A song, a song high above the trees <br />
With a voice as big as the the sea <br />
With a voice as big as the the sea" <br />
<br>
<br />
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king <br />
"Do you know what I know? <br />
In your palace warm, mighty king <br />
Do you know what I know? <br />
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold <br />
Let us bring him silver and gold <br />
Let us bring him silver and gold" <br />
<br />
Said the king to the people everywhere <br />
"Listen to what I say <br />
Pray for peace, people, everywhere <br />
Listen to what I say <br />
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night <br />
He will bring us goodness and light <br />
He will bring us goodness and light"</p>
