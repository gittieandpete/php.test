The jingle bells are jingling<br />
The streets<br />
Are white with snow<br />
The happy crowds are mingling<br />
But there's no one that I know I'm sure that you'll forgive me<br />
If I don't enthuse<br />
I guess<br />
I've got the Christmas blues I've done my window shopping<br />
There's not a store I've missed<br />
But what's the use of stopping<br />
When there's no one on your list You'll know the way I'm feeling<br />
When you love and you lose<br />
I guess<br />
I've got the Christmas blues When somebody wants you<br />
Somebody needs you<br />
Christmas is a joy of joys<br />
But friends when you're lonely<br />
You'll find that it's only<br />
<br>
A thing for little girls<br />
And little boys May all your days be merry<br />
Your seasons full of cheer<br />
But 'til it's January<br />
I'll just go and disappear<br />
Oh Santa<br />
May have brought you<br />
Some stars for your shoes But Santa only brought me<br />
The blues<br />
Those brightly packaged<br />
Tinsel covered<br />
Christmas blues Oh Santa<br />
May have brought you<br />
Some stars for your shoes<br />
But Santa only brought me<br />
The blues<br />
Those brightly packaged<br />
Tinsel covered<br />
Christmas blues</p>
