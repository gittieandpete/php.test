The First Noel<br />
The angel did say<br />
Was to certain<br />
Poor shepherds<br />
In fields as they lay<br />
In fields where they may<br />
Keeping their sheep<br />
On a cold winter's night<br />
That was so deep<br />
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br />
Born is the King of Israel<br />
<br />
They looked up<br />
And saw a star<br />
Shining in the East<br />
Beyond them far<br />
And to the Earth<br />
<br>
It gave great light<br />
And so it continued<br />
Both day and night<br />
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br />
Born is the King of Israel<br />
<br />
This by the light<br />
Of that same star<br />
Three wise man came<br />
From country far<br />
To seek a king<br />
Was there intent<br />
And to follow the star<br />
Wherever it went<br />
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br />
Born is the King of Israel<br />
Noel</p>
