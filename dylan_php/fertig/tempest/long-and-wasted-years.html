It's been such a long, long time<br />
Since we loved each other and our hearts were true<br />
One time, for one brief day, I was the man for you<br />
<br />
Last night I heard you talking in your sleep<br />
Saying things you shouldn't say<br />
Oh baby, you just might have to go to jail someday<br />
<br />
Is there a place we can go?<br />
Is there anybody we can see?<br />
Maybe, it's the same for you as it is for me<br />
<br />
I ain't seen my family in twenty years<br />
That ain't easy to understand<br />
They may be dead by now<br />
I lost track of them after they lost their land<br />
<br />
Shake it up baby twist and shout<br />
You know what it's all about<br />
What are you doing out there in the sun anyway?<br />
Don't you know the sun can burn your brains right out?<br />
<br>
<br />
My enemy crashed into the dust<br />
Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust<br />
He was run down hard and he broke apart<br />
He died in shame he had an iron heart<br />
<br />
I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes<br />
There are secrets in them I can't disguise<br />
Come back baby if I ever hurt your feelings I apologize<br />
<br />
Two trains running side by side<br />
Forty miles wide, down the eastern line<br />
You don't have to go<br />
I just came to you because your a friend of mine<br />
<br />
I think that when my back was turned<br />
The whole world behind me burned<br />
It's been awhile since we walked down that long, long aisle<br />
<br />
We cried on that cold and frosty morn<br />
We cried because our souls were torn<br />
So much for tears, so much for these long and wasted years</p>
