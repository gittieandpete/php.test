[Verse 1]<br />
The pale moon rose in its glory<br />
Out o'er the Western town<br />
She told a sad, sad story<br />
Of the great ship that went down<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
T'was the fourteenth day of April<br />
Over the waves she rode<br />
Sailing into tomorrow<br />
To a gilded age foretold<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
The night was black with starlight<br />
The seas were sharp and clear<br />
Moving through the shadows<br />
The promised hour was near<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Lights were holding steady<br />
Gliding over the foam<br />
All the lords and ladies<br />
Heading for their eternal home<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
The chandeliers were swaying<br />
From the balustrades above<br />
The orchestra was playing<br />
Songs of faded love<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
The watchman, he lay dreaming<br />
As the ballroom dancers twirled<br />
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br />
Into the underworld<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
Leo took his sketchbook<br />
He was often so inclined<br />
He closed his eyes and painted<br />
The scenery in his mind<br />
<br />
[Verse 8]<br />
Cupid struck his bosom<br />
And broke it with a snap<br />
The closest woman to him<br />
He fell into her lap<br />
<br />
[Verse 9]<br />
He heard a loud commotion<br />
Something sounded wrong<br />
His inner spirit was saying<br />
That he couldn't stand here long<br />
<br />
[Verse 10]<br />
He staggered to the quarterdeck<br />
No time now to sleep<br />
Water on the quarterdeck<br />
Already three foot deep<br />
<br />
[Verse 11]<br />
Smokestack was leaning sideways<br />
Heavy feet began to pound<br />
He walked into the whirlwind<br />
Sky splitting all around<br />
<br />
[Verse 12]<br />
The ship was going under<br />
The universe had opened wide<br />
The roll was called up yonder<br />
The angels turned aside<br />
<br />
[Verse 13]<br />
Lights down in the hallway<br />
Flickering dim and dull<br />
Dead bodies already floating<br />
In the double bottom hull<br />
<br />
[Verse 14]<br />
The engines then exploded<br />
Propellers they failed to start<br />
The boilers overloaded<br />
The ship's bow split apart<br />
<br />
[Verse 15]<br />
Passengers were flying<br />
Backward, forward, far and fast<br />
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled<br />
Each one more weary than the last<br />
<br />
[Verse 16]<br />
The veil was torn asunder<br />
'Tween the hours of twelve and one<br />
No change, no sudden wonder<br />
Could undo what had been done<br />
<br />
[Verse 17]<br />
The watchman lay there dreaming<br />
At forty-five degrees<br />
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking<br />
Dropping to her knees<br />
<br />
[Verse 18]<br />
Wellington he was sleeping<br />
His bed began to slide<br />
His valiant heart was beating<br />
He pushed the tables aside<br />
<br />
[Verse 19]<br />
Glass of shattered crystal<br />
Lay scattered roundabout<br />
He strapped on both his pistols<br />
How long could he hold out?<br />
<br />
[Verse 20]<br />
His men and his companions<br />
Were nowhere to be seen<br />
In silence there he waited for<br />
Time and space to intervene<br />
<br />
[Verse 21]<br />
The passageway was narrow<br />
There was blackness in the air<br />
He saw every kind of sorrow<br />
Heard voices everywhere<br />
<br />
[Verse 22]<br />
Alarm-bells were ringing<br />
To hold back the swelling tide<br />
Friends and lovers clinging<br />
To each other side by side<br />
<br />
[Verse 23]<br />
Mothers and their daughters<br />
<br>
Descending down the stairs<br />
Jumped into the icy waters<br />
Love and pity sent their prayers<br />
<br />
[Verse 24]<br />
The rich man, Mister Astor<br />
Kissed his darling wife<br />
He had no way of knowing<br />
Be the last trip of his life<br />
<br />
[Verse 25]<br />
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson<br />
Gambled in the dark<br />
Not one of them would ever live to<br />
Tell the tale or disembark<br />
<br />
[Verse 26]<br />
Brother rose up 'gainst brother<br />
In every circumstance<br />
They fought and slaughtered each other<br />
In a deadly dance<br />
<br />
[Verse 27]<br />
They lowered down the lifeboats<br />
From the sinking wreck<br />
There were traitors, there were turncoats<br />
Broken backs and broken necks<br />
<br />
[Verse 28]<br />
The bishop left his cabin<br />
To help all those in need<br />
Turned his eyes up to the heavens<br />
Said, "The poor are yours to feed"<br />
<br />
[Verse 29]<br />
Davey the brothel-keeper<br />
Came out dismissed his girls<br />
Saw the water getting deeper<br />
Saw the changing of his world<br />
<br />
[Verse 30]<br />
Jim Backus smiled<br />
He never learned to swim<br />
Saw the little crippled child<br />
And he gave his seat to him<br />
<br />
[Verse 31]<br />
He saw the starlight shining<br />
Streaming from the East<br />
Death was on the rampage<br />
But his heart was now at peace<br />
<br />
[Verse 32]<br />
They battened down the hatches<br />
But the hatches wouldn't hold<br />
They drowned upon the staircase<br />
Of brass and polished gold<br />
<br />
[Verse 33]<br />
Leo said to Cleo<br />
I think I'm going mad<br />
But he'd lost his mind already<br />
Whatever mind he had<br />
<br />
[Verse 34]<br />
He tried to block the doorway<br />
To save all those from harm<br />
Blood from an open wound<br />
Pouring down his arm<br />
<br />
[Verse 35]<br />
Petals fell from flowers<br />
Tell all of them were gone<br />
In the long and dreadful hours<br />
The wizard's curse played on<br />
<br />
[Verse 36]<br />
The host was pouring brandy<br />
He was going down slow<br />
He stayed right to the end and he<br />
Was the last to go<br />
<br />
[Verse 37]<br />
There were many, many others<br />
Nameless here forever more<br />
They never sailed the ocean<br />
Or left their homes before<br />
<br />
[Verse 38]<br />
The watchman, he lay dreaming<br />
The damage had been done<br />
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br />
And he tried to tell someone<br />
<br />
[Verse 39]<br />
The captain, barely breathing<br />
Kneeling at the wheel<br />
Above him and beneath him<br />
Fifty thousand tons of steel<br />
<br />
[Verse 40]<br />
He looked over at his compass<br />
And he gazed into its face<br />
Needle pointing downward<br />
He knew he lost the race<br />
<br />
[Verse 41]<br />
In the dark illumination<br />
He remembered bygone years<br />
He read the Book of Revelation<br />
And he filled his cup with tears<br />
<br />
[Verse 42]<br />
When the Reaper's task had ended<br />
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest<br />
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor<br />
The loveliest and the best<br />
<br />
[Verse 43]<br />
They waited at the landing<br />
And they tried to understand<br />
But there is no understanding<br />
For the judgment of God's hand<br />
<br />
[Verse 44]<br />
The news came over the wires<br />
And struck with deadly force<br />
The love had lost its fires<br />
All things had run their course<br />
<br />
[Verse 45]<br />
The watchman he lay dreaming<br />
Of all the things that can be<br />
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br />
Into the deep blue sea</p>
