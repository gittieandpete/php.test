All the early Roman kings<br />
In their sharkskin suits<br />
Bow ties and buttons<br />
High top boots<br />
Drivin' the spikes in<br />
Blazin' the rails<br />
Nailed in their coffins<br />
In top hats and tails<br />
Fly away, little bird<br />
Fly away, flap your wings<br />
Fly by night<br />
Like the early Roman kings<br />
<br />
All the early roman kings<br />
In the early early morn<br />
Coming down the mountain<br />
Distributing the corn<br />
Speeding through the forest<br />
Racing down the track<br />
You try to get away<br />
They drag you back<br />
Tomorrow is Friday<br />
We'll see what it brings<br />
Everybody's talking<br />
Bout the early roman kings<br />
<br />
They're peddlers and they're meddlers<br />
They buy and they sell<br />
They destroyed your city<br />
They'll destroy you as well<br />
They're lecherous and treacherous<br />
Hell-bent for leather<br />
Each of 'em bigger<br />
Than all them put together<br />
Sluggers and muggers<br />
Wearing fancy gold rings<br />
All the women goin' crazy<br />
For the early Roman kings<br />
<br>
<br />
I can dress up your wounds<br />
With a blood-clotted rag<br />
I ain't afraid to make love<br />
To a bitch or a hag<br />
If you see me comin'<br />
And you're standing there<br />
Wave your handkerchief<br />
In the air<br />
I ain't dead yet<br />
Ma Bell still rings<br />
I keep my fingers crossed<br />
Like them early roman kings<br />
<br />
I can strip you of life<br />
Strip you of breath<br />
Ship you down<br />
To the house of death<br />
One day<br />
You will ask for me<br />
There'll be no one else<br />
That you'll wanna see<br />
Bring down my fiddle<br />
Tune up my strings<br />
I'm gonna break it wide open<br />
Like the early roman kings<br />
<br />
I was up on black mountain<br />
The day Detroit fell<br />
They killed 'em all off<br />
And they sent 'em to hell<br />
Ding dong daddy<br />
You're coming up short<br />
Gonna put you on trial<br />
In a Sicilian court<br />
I've had my fun<br />
I've had my flings<br />
Gonna shake em all down<br />
Like the early roman kings</p>
