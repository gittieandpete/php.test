I'm searching for phrases<br />
To sing your praises<br />
I need to tell someone<br />
It's soon after midnight<br />
And my day has just begun<br />
<br />
A gal named Honey<br />
Took my money<br />
She was passing by<br />
It's soon after midnight<br />
And the moon is in my eye<br />
<br />
My heart is cheerful<br />
It's never fearful<br />
I've been down on the killing floors<br />
I'm in no great hurry<br />
I'm not afraid of your fury<br />
I've faced stronger walls than yours<br />
<br>
<br />
Charlotte's a harlot<br />
Dresses in scarlet<br />
Mary dresses in green<br />
It's soon after midnight<br />
And I've got a date with the fairy queen<br />
<br />
They chirp and they chatter<br />
What does it matter?<br />
They lie and they dine in their blood<br />
Two timing slim<br />
Who's ever heard of him?<br />
I'll drag his corpse through the mud<br />
<br />
It's now or never<br />
More than ever<br />
When I met you I didn't think you'd do<br />
It's soon after midnight<br />
And I don't want nobody but you</p>
