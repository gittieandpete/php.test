Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure<br />
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure<br />
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun<br />
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done<br />
Sooner or later you make a mistake,<br />
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break<br />
Legs and arms and body and bone<br />
I pay in blood, but not my own<br />
<br />
Night after night, Day after day<br />
They strip your useless hopes away<br />
The more I take the more I give<br />
The more I die the more I live<br />
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim<br />
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb<br />
I'm circlin' around the Southern Zone<br />
I'll pay in blood, but not my own.<br />
<br />
Low cards are what I've got<br />
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not<br />
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God<br />
You could put me out in front of a firing squad<br />
I've been out and around with the rising men<br />
Just like you my handsome friend<br />
My head's so hard, must be made of stone<br />
I pay in blood, but not my own<br />
<br>
<br />
Another politician coming out the abyss<br />
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss<br />
You got the same eyes that your mother does<br />
If only you could prove who your father was<br />
Someone must of slipped a drug in yer wine<br />
You gulped it down and you cross the line<br />
Man can't live by bread alone<br />
I pay in blood, but not my own<br />
<br />
How I made it back home, nobody knows<br />
Or how I survived so many blows<br />
I've been thru Hell, What good did it do?<br />
You bastard! I'm supposed to respect you!<br />
I'll give you justice, I'll fathom your purse<br />
Show me your moral that you reversed<br />
<br />
Hear me holler and hear me moan<br />
I pay in blood but not my own<br />
You get your lover in the bed<br />
Come here I'll break your lousy head<br />
Our nation must be saved and freed<br />
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?<br />
This is how I spend my days<br />
I came to bury, not to praise<br />
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone<br />
I play in blood, but not my own</p>
