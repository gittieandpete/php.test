Doctor, doctor, tell me the time of day<br />
Another bottle's empty<br />
Another penny spent<br />
He turned around and he slowly walked away<br />
They shot him in the back and down he went<br />
<br />
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John<br />
From the Liverpool docks to the red light Hamburg streets<br />
Down in the quarry with the Quarrymen.<br />
Playing to the big crowds Playing to the cheap seats<br />
Another day in your life until your journey&rsquo;s end<br />
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John<br />
<br />
Sailing through the tradewinds<br />
Bound for the sun<br />
Rags on your back just like any other slave<br />
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth<br />
Wasn&rsquo;t no way out of that deep dark cave<br />
<br />
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John<br />
I heard the news today, oh boy<br />
They hauled your ship up on the shore<br />
Now the city&rsquo;s gone dark<br />
There is no more joy<br />
They tore the heart right out and cut it to the core<br />
<br>
<br />
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John<br />
Put on your bags and get â€˜em packed.<br />
Leave right now you won&rsquo;t be far from wrong<br />
The sooner you go, the quicker you&rsquo;ll be back<br />
You&rsquo;ve been cooped up on an island far too long<br />
<br />
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John<br />
Slow down you&rsquo;re moving too fast<br />
Come together right now over me<br />
Your bones are weary<br />
You&rsquo;re about to breathe your last<br />
Lord, you know how hard that it can be<br />
<br />
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John<br />
Roll on John, roll through the rain and snow<br />
Take the righthand road and go where the buffalo roam<br />
They&rsquo;ll trap you in an ambush before you know<br />
Too late now to sail back home<br />
<br />
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John<br />
Tyger, Tyger burning bright<br />
I pray the lord my soul to keep In the forest of the night<br />
Cover him over and let him sleep<br />
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John.</p>
