[Verse 1]<br />
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away<br />
I wanna stop at Carbondale and keep on going<br />
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day<br />
<br />
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp<br />
But I ain't neither one<br />
<br />
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />
Sounding like it's on a final run<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />
Blowing like she never blowed before<br />
Blue light blinking, red light glowing<br />
Blowing like she's at my chamber door<br />
<br />
You smiling through the fence at me<br />
Just like you always smiled before<br />
<br />
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?<br />
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart<br />
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going<br />
You're like a time bomb in my heart<br />
<br>
<br />
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling<br />
Must be the mother of our Lord<br />
<br />
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />
Blowing like my woman's on board<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away<br />
You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going<br />
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day<br />
<br />
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed<br />
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head<br />
<br />
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?<br />
Blowing through another no good town<br />
<br />
The lights on my native land are glowing<br />
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round<br />
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing<br />
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb<br />
<br />
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />
Blowing like she's blowing right on time</p>
