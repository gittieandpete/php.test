Just a minute before you leave girl<br />
Just a minute before you touch the door<br />
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl ?<br />
Do you think we can talk about it some more ?<br />
You know, the streets are filled with vipers<br />
Who've lost all ray of hope<br />
You know, it ain't even safe no more<br />
In the palace of the Pope.<br />
<br />
Don't fall apart on me tonight<br />
I just don't think that I could handle it<br />
Don't fall apart on me tonight<br />
Yesterday's just a memory<br />
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be<br />
And I need you, yeah.<br />
<br />
Come over here from over there, girl<br />
Sit down here, you can have my chair<br />
I can't see us going anywhere, girl<br />
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there<br />
I wish I'd have been a doctor<br />
Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost<br />
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world<br />
'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.<br />
<br />
Don't fall apart on me tonight<br />
I just don't think that I could handle it<br />
Don't fall apart on me tonight<br />
Yesterday's just a memory<br />
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be<br />
And I need you, yeah.<br />
<br />
I ain't too good at conversation, girl<br />
So you might not know exactly how I feel<br />
But if I could, I'd bring bring you to the mountaintop, girl<br />
And build you a house made out of stainless steel<br />
<br>
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting<br />
That's hanging in the Louvre<br />
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches<br />
But I know that I can't move.<br />
Don't fall apart on me tonight<br />
I just don't think that I could handle it<br />
Don't fall apart on me tonight<br />
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on<br />
Tomorrow's just one step beyond<br />
And I need you, yeah.<br />
<br />
Who are these people who are walking towards you<br />
Do you know them or will there be a fight ?<br />
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through<br />
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right ?<br />
<br />
Do you remember St. James Street<br />
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind ?<br />
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet<br />
And laid his life on the line.<br />
<br />
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl<br />
No more booby traps and bombs<br />
No more decadence and charm<br />
No more affection that's misplaced, girl<br />
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms<br />
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants ?<br />
He looked so baffled and so bewildered<br />
When he played and we didn't dance.<br />
<br />
Don't fall apart on me tonight<br />
I just don't think that I could handle it<br />
Don't fall apart on me tonight<br />
Yesterday's just a memory<br />
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be<br />
And I need you, yeah.</p>
