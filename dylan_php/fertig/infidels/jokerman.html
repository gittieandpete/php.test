Standing on the water, casting your bread<br />
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing<br />
Distant ships sailing into the mist<br />
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing<br />
Freedom just around the corner for you<br />
But with truth so far off, what good will it do.<br />
<br />
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune<br />
Bird fly high by the light of the moon<br />
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.<br />
<br />
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky<br />
You rise up and say goodbye to no one<br />
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread<br />
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one<br />
Shedding off one more layer of skin<br />
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.<br />
<br />
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune<br />
Bird fly high by the light of the moon<br />
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.<br />
<br />
You're a man of the mountain, you can walk on the clouds<br />
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister<br />
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah<br />
But what do you care ? Ain't nobody there would want marry your sister<br />
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame<br />
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.<br />
<br />
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune<br />
Bird fly high by the light of the moon<br />
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.<br />
<br />
<br>
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy<br />
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers<br />
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed<br />
Michelangeo indeed could've carved out your features<br />
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space<br />
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.<br />
<br />
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune<br />
Bird fly high by the light of the moon<br />
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.<br />
<br />
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame<br />
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain <br />
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks<br />
Molotow cocktails and rocks behind every curtain<br />
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin<br />
Only a matter of time 'til the night comes stepping in.<br />
<br />
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune<br />
Bird fly high by the light of the moon<br />
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.<br />
<br />
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray<br />
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet<br />
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat<br />
Take the motherless children off the street<br />
And place them at the feet of a harlot<br />
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants<br />
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.<br />
<br />
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune<br />
Bird fly high by the light of the moon<br />
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.</p>
