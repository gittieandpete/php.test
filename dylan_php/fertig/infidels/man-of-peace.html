Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch<br />
The band is playing "Dixie", a man got his hand outstretched<br />
Could be the F?hrer<br />
Could be the local priest<br />
You know sometimes Satan, you know he comes as a man of peace.<br />
<br />
He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue<br />
He knows every song of love that ever has been sung<br />
Good intentions can be evil<br />
Both hands can be full of grease<br />
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.<br />
<br />
Well, first he's in the background, and then he's in the front<br />
Both eyes are looking like they're on a rabbit hunt<br />
Nobody can see through him<br />
No, not even the Chief of Police<br />
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.<br />
<br />
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun<br />
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton<br />
He could be standing next to you<br />
The person that you'd notice least<br />
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull<br />
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull<br />
I can smell something cooking<br />
I can tell there's going to be a feast<br />
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.<br />
<br />
He's a great humanitarian, he's great philanthropist<br />
He knows just where to touch you honey, and how you like to be kissed<br />
He'll put both his arms around you<br />
You can feel the tender touch of the beast<br />
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.<br />
<br />
Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl<br />
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall<br />
Wanna get married ? Do it now<br />
Tomorrow all activity will cease<br />
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.<br />
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy<br />
She's holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy<br />
And he's following a star<br />
The same one them three men followed from the East<br />
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.</p>
