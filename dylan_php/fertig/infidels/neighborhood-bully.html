Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man<br />
His enemies say he's on their land<br />
They got him outnumbered about a million to one<br />
He got no place to escape to, no place to run<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
The neighborhood bully he just lives to survive<br />
He's criticized and condemned for being alive<br />
He's not supposed to fight back, he's supposed to have thick skin<br />
He's supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land<br />
He's wandered the earth an exiled man<br />
Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn<br />
He's always on trial for just being born<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized<br />
Old women condemned him, said he could apologize<br />
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad<br />
The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
Well, the chances are against it, and the odds are slim<br />
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him<br />
'Cause there's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back<br />
And a licence to kill him is given out to every maniac<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
Well, he got no allies to really speak of<br />
What he gets he must pay for, he don't get it out of love<br />
<br>
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied<br />
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace<br />
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease<br />
Now, they wouldn't hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep<br />
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone<br />
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon<br />
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand<br />
In bed with nobody, under no one's command<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
Now his holiest books have been trampled upon<br />
No contract that he signed was worth that what it was written on<br />
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth<br />
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
What's anybody indebted to him for ?<br />
Nothing, they say. He just likes to cause war<br />
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed<br />
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed<br />
He's the neighborhood bully.<br />
<br />
What has he done to wear so many scars ?<br />
Does he change the course of rivers ? Does he pollute the moon and stars ?<br />
Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill<br />
Running out the clock, time standing still<br />
Neighborhood bully.</p>
