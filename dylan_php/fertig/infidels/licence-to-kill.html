Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please <br />
And if things don't change soon, he will. <br />
For man has invented his doom, <br />
First step was touching the moon. <br />
<br />
Now, there's a woman on my block, <br />
She just sit there as the night grows still. <br />
She say who gonna take away his license to kill? <br />
<br />
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life <br />
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill, <br />
Then they bury him with stars, <br />
Sell his body like they do used cars. <br />
<br />
Now, there's a woman on my block, <br />
She just sit there facin' the hill. <br />
She say who gonna take away his license to kill? <br />
<br />
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused, <br />
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill. <br />
All he believes are his eyes <br />
<br>
And his eyes, they just tell him lies. <br />
<br />
But there's a woman on my block, <br />
Sitting there in a cold chill. <br />
She say who gonna take away his license to kill? <br />
<br />
May be a noisemaker, spirit maker, <br />
Heartbreaker, backbreaker, <br />
Leave no stone unturned. <br />
May be an actor in a plot, <br />
That might be all that you got <br />
'Til your error you clearly learn. <br />
<br />
Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool <br />
And when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled. <br />
Oh, man is opposed to fair play, <br />
He wants it all and he wants it his way. <br />
<br />
Now, there's a woman on my block, <br />
She just sit there as the night grows still. <br />
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?</p>
