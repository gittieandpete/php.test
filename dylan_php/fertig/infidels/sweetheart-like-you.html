Well the pressure's down, the boss ain't here<br />
He gone North, for a while <br />
They say that vanity got the best of him<br />
But he sure left here in style<br />
By the way, that's a cute hat<br />
And that smile's so hard to resist<br />
But what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?<br />
<br />
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you<br />
She wanted a whole man, not just a half<br />
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child<br />
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh<br />
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear<br />
It's done with a flick of the wrist<br />
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?<br />
<br />
You know, a woman like you should be at home <br />
That's where you belong<br />
Taking care for somebody nice <br />
Who don't know how to do you wrong<br />
Just how much abuse will you be able to take ?<br />
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss<br />
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?<br />
<br />
<br>
You know you can make a name for yourself<br />
You can hear them tires squeal<br />
You can be known as the most beautiful woman<br />
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.<br />
<br />
You know, news of you has come down the line<br />
Even before ya came in the door<br />
They say in your father's house, there's many mansions<br />
Each one of them got a fireproof floor<br />
Snap out of it baby, people are jealous of you<br />
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss<br />
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?<br />
<br />
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey<br />
Got to have done some evil deed<br />
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door<br />
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.<br />
They say that patriotism is the last refuge<br />
To which a scoundrel clings<br />
Steal a little and they throw you in jail<br />
Steal a lot and they make you king<br />
There's only one step down from here, baby<br />
It's called the land of permanent bliss<br />
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?</p>
