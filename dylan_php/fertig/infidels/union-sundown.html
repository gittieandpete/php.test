Well, my shoes, they comes from Singapore<br />
My flashlight's from Taiwan<br />
My tablecloth's from Malayisia<br />
My belt buckle's from the Amazon<br />
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines<br />
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet<br />
It was put together down in Argentina<br />
By a guy making thirty cents a day.<br />
<br />
Well, it's sundown on the union<br />
And what's made in the USA<br />
Sure was a good idea<br />
'Til greed got in the way.<br />
<br />
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong<br />
And the pearls are from Japan<br />
Well, the dog collar's from India<br />
And the flower pot's from Pakistan<br />
All the furniture it said "Made in Brazil"<br />
Where a woman, she slaved for sure<br />
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve<br />
You know, that's a lot of money to her.<br />
<br />
Well, it's sundown on the union<br />
And what's made in the USA<br />
Sure was a good idea<br />
'Til greed got in the way.<br />
<br />
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work<br />
I say, "Why you say that for<br />
When nothing you got is US made ?"<br />
They don't make nothing here no more<br />
You know, capitalism is above the law<br />
It say, "it don't count 'less it sells"<br />
<br>
When it costs too much to build it at home<br />
You just build it cheaper someplace else.<br />
<br />
Well, it's sundown on the union<br />
And what's made in the USA<br />
Sure was a good idea<br />
'Til greed got in the way.<br />
Well, the job that you used to have<br />
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador<br />
The unions are big business, friend<br />
And they're going out like a dinosaur<br />
They used to grow food in Kansas <br />
Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw<br />
I can see the day coming when even your home garden<br />
Is gonna be against the law.<br />
<br />
Well, it's sundown on the union<br />
And what's made in the USA<br />
Sure was a good idea<br />
'Til greed got in the way.<br />
<br />
Democracy don't rule the world<br />
You'd better get that in your head<br />
This world is ruled by violence<br />
But I guess that's better left unsaid<br />
From Broadway to the Milky Way<br />
That's a lot of territory indeed<br />
And a man's gonna do what he has to do<br />
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.<br />
<br />
Well, it's sundown on the union<br />
And what's made in the USA<br />
Sure was a good idea<br />
'Til greed got in the way.</p>
