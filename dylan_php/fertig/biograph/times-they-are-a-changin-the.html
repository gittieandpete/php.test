Come gather 'round people wherever you roam<br />
Admit that the waters around you have grown<br />
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone<br />
If your time to you is worth savin'<br />
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone<br />
For the times they are a-changin' Come writers and critics who prophetize with your pen<br />
Keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again<br />
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin<br />
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'<br />
For the loser now might be later to win<br />
<br>
For the times they are a-changin' Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call<br />
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall<br />
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled<br />
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'<br />
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls<br />
For the times they are a-changin' Come mothers and fathers throughout the land<br />
And don't criticize what you can't understand<br />
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command<br />
Your old road is rapidly agin'<br />
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand<br />
For the times they are a-changin'</p>
