Senor, senor, do you know where we're headin'?<br />
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?<br />
Seems like I been down this way before.<br />
Is there any truth in that, senor? Senor, senor, do you know where she is hidin'?<br />
How long are we gonna be ridin'?<br />
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?<br />
Will there be any comfort there, senor? There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck,<br />
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck.<br />
There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot<br />
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not." Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon,<br />
I can smell the tail of the dragon.<br />
<br>
Can't stand the suspense anymore.<br />
Can you tell me who to contact here, senor? Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled<br />
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field.<br />
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring<br />
Said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing." Senor, senor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather.<br />
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together.<br />
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor.<br />
I'm ready when you are, senor. Senor, senor, let's disconnect these cables,<br />
Overturn these tables.<br />
This place don't make sense to me no more.<br />
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor?</p>
