Lay down your weary tune, lay down,<br />
Lay down the song you strum,<br />
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings<br />
No voice can hope to hum.<br />
<br />
Struck by the sounds before the sun,<br />
I knew the night had gone.<br />
The morning breeze like a bugle blew<br />
Against the drums of dawn.<br />
Lay down your weary tune, lay down,<br />
Lay down the song you strum,<br />
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings<br />
No voice can hope to hum.<br />
<br />
The ocean wild like an organ played,<br />
The seaweed's wove its strands.<br />
The crashin' waves like cymbals clashed<br />
Against the rocks and sands.<br />
Lay down your weary tune, lay down,<br />
Lay down the song you strum,<br />
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings<br />
No voice can hope to hum.<br />
<br />
<br>
I stood unwound beneath the skies<br />
And clouds unbound by laws.<br />
The cryin' rain like a trumpet sang<br />
And asked for no applause.<br />
Lay down your weary tune, lay down,<br />
Lay down the song you strum,<br />
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings<br />
No voice can hope to hum.<br />
<br />
The last of leaves fell from the trees<br />
And clung to a new love's breast.<br />
The branches bare like a banjo played<br />
To the winds that listened best.<br />
<br />
I gazed down in the river's mirror<br />
And watched its winding strum.<br />
The water smooth ran like a hymn<br />
And like a harp did hum.<br />
Lay down your weary tune, lay down,<br />
Lay down the song you strum,<br />
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings<br />
No voice can hope to hum.<br />
