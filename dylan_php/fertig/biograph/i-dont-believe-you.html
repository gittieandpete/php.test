I can't understand, she let go of my hand<br />
An' left me here facing the wall<br />
I'd sure like to know, why she did go<br />
But I can't get close to her at all Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime<br />
She said she would never forget<br />
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here<br />
She acts like we never met It's all new to me like some mystery<br />
It could even be like a myth<br />
But it's hard to think on that she's the same one<br />
That last night I was with From darkness, dreams are deserted<br />
Am I still dreamin' yet?<br />
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk<br />
'Stead of acting like we never met If she ain't feelin' well, then why don't she tell<br />
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?<br />
Without any doubt, she seems too far out<br />
<br>
For me to return to her chase Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played<br />
Her mouth was watery and wet<br />
But now something has changed for she ain't the same<br />
She just acts like we never have met If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess<br />
To anything I might've tried<br />
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong<br />
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide Though the night ran swirling an' whirling<br />
I remember her whispering yet<br />
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't<br />
She just acts like we never have met I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way<br />
Of this I can't say very much<br />
But if you want me to, I can be just like you<br />
An' pretend that we never have touched An' if anybody asks me, "is it easy to forget?"<br />
I'll say, "it's easily done<br />
You just pick anyone<br />
An' pretend that you never have met"</p>
