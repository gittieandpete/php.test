You say you love me and you're<br />
Thinkin' of me, but you<br />
Know you could be wrong<br />
You say you told me that you<br />
Wanna hold me, but you<br />
Know you're not that strong<br />
I just can't do what I done before<br />
I just can't beg you anymore<br />
I'm gonna let you pass<br />
And I'll go last<br />
Then time will tell just who fell<br />
And who's been left behind<br />
When you go your way and I go mine You say you disturb me and you<br />
Don't deserve me but you<br />
Know sometimes you lie<br />
You say you're shakin' and you're<br />
Always achin', but you<br />
Know how hard you try<br />
Sometimes it gets so hard to care<br />
<br>
It can't be this way ev'rywhere<br />
And I'm gonna let you pass<br />
Yes, and I'll go last<br />
Then time will tell who has fell<br />
And who's been left behind<br />
When you go your way and I go mine Well and , the judge, he holds a grudge<br />
He's gonna call on you<br />
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts<br />
Watch out he don't fall on you You say you're sorry for<br />
Tellin' stories that you<br />
Know I believe are true<br />
You say ya got some otha<br />
Kinda lover and yes, I believe you do<br />
You say my kisses are not like his<br />
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is<br />
I'm just gonna let you pass<br />
Yes, and I'll go last<br />
Then time will tell who has fell<br />
And who's been left behind<br />
When you go your way and I go mine</p>
