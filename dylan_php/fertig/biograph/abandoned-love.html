I can hear the turning of the key<br />
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.<br />
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain<br />
Oh, something's a-telling me i wear the ball and chain.<br />
<br />
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost<br />
He's always off somewhere when i need him most.<br />
The spanish moon is rising on the hill<br />
But my heart is a-tellin' me i love ya still.<br />
<br />
I come back to the town from the flaming moon<br />
I see you in the streets, i begin to swoon.<br />
I love to see you dress before the mirror<br />
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore i finally disappear?<br />
<br />
Everybody's wearing a disguise<br />
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.<br />
But me, i can't cover what i am<br />
Wherever the children go i'll follow them.<br />
<br />
<br>
I march in the parade of liberty<br />
But as long as i love you i'm not free.<br />
How long must i suffer such abuse<br />
Won't you let me see you smile one time before i turn you loose?<br />
<br />
I've given up the game, i've got to leave,<br />
The pot of gold is only make-believe.<br />
The treasure can't be found by men who search<br />
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.<br />
<br />
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,<br />
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.<br />
My head tells me it's time to make a change<br />
But my heart is telling me i love ya but you're strange.<br />
<br />
One more time at midnight, near the wall<br />
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.<br />
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?<br />
Let me feel your love one more time before i abandon it.<br />
