Bad news, bad news,<br />
Come to me where i sleep,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
Sayin' one of your friends<br />
Is in trouble deep,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
Tell me the trouble,<br />
Tell once to my ear,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
Joliet prison<br />
And ninety-nine years,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
Oh what's the charge<br />
Of how this came to be,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
Manslaughter<br />
In the highest of degree,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
I sat down and wrote<br />
The best words i could write,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
Explaining to the judge<br />
I'd be there on wednesday night,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
Without a reply,<br />
I left by the moon,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
And was in his chambers<br />
By the next afternoon,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
Could ya tell me the facts?<br />
I said without fear,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
That a friend of mine<br />
Would get ninety-nine years,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
A crash on the highway<br />
Flew the car to a field,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
There was four persons killed<br />
And he was at the wheel,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
But i knew him as good<br />
As i'm knowin' myself,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
And he wouldn't harm a life<br />
That belonged to someone else,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
<br>
The judge spoke<br />
Out of the side of his mouth,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
Sayin', &quot;the witness who saw,<br />
He left little doubt,&quot;<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
That may be true,<br />
He's got a sentence to serve,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
But ninety-nine years,<br />
He just don't deserve,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
Too late, too late,<br />
For his case it is sealed,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
His sentence is passed<br />
And it cannot be repealed,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
But he ain't no criminal<br />
And his crime it is none,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
What happened to him<br />
Could happen to anyone,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
And at that the judge jerked forward<br />
And his face it did freeze,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
Sayin', &quot;could you kindly leave<br />
My office now, please,&quot;<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
Well his eyes looked funny<br />
And i stood up so slow,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
With no other choice<br />
Except for to go,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
I walked down the hallway<br />
And i heard his door slam,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
I walked down the courthouse stairs<br />
And i did not understand,<br />
Turn, turn to the rain<br />
And the wind.<br />
<br />
And i played my guitar<br />
Through the night to the day,<br />
Turn, turn, turn again.<br />
And the only tune<br />
My guitar could play<br />
Was, &quot;oh the cruel rain<br />
And the wind.&quot;<br />
