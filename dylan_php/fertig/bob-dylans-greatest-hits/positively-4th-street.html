You got a lotta nerve<br />
To say you are my friend<br />
When i was down<br />
You just stood there grinning<br />
<br />
You got a lotta nerve<br />
To say you gota helping hand to lend<br />
You just want to be on<br />
The side that's winning<br />
<br />
You say i let you down<br />
You know it's not like that<br />
If you're so hurt<br />
Why then don't you show it<br />
<br />
You say you lost your faith<br />
But that's not where it's at<br />
You had no faith to lose<br />
And you know it<br />
<br />
I know the reason<br />
That you talk behind my back<br />
I used to be among the crowd<br />
You're in with<br />
<br />
Do you take me for such a fool<br />
To think i'd make contact<br />
With the one who tries to hide<br />
What he don't know to begin with<br />
<br />
<br>
You see me on the street<br />
You always act surprised<br />
You say, &quot;how are you?&quot; &quot;good luck&quot;<br />
But you don't mean it<br />
<br />
When you know as well as me<br />
You'd rather see me paralyzed<br />
Why don't you just come out once<br />
And scream it<br />
<br />
No, i do not feel that good<br />
When i see the heartbreaks you embrace<br />
If i was a master thief<br />
Perhaps i'd rob them<br />
<br />
And now i know you're dissatisfied<br />
With your position and your place<br />
Don't you understand<br />
It's not my problem<br />
<br />
I wish that for just one time<br />
You could stand inside my shoes<br />
And just for that one moment<br />
I could be you<br />
<br />
Yes, i wish that for just one time<br />
You could stand inside my shoes<br />
You'd know what a drag it is<br />
To see you<br />
