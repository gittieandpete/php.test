Frankie was a good girl<br />
Everybody knows<br />
Paid one hundred dollars<br />
For Albert's new suit of clothes<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.<br />
<br />
Albert said &quot;I'm leaving you&quot;<br />
Won't be gone for long<br />
Don't wait up for me<br />
A-worry about me when I'm gone<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.<br />
<br />
Frankie went down to the corner saloon<br />
Get a bucket of beer<br />
Said to the bartender<br />
&quot;Has my lovin' man been her ?&quot;<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I ain't gonna tell you no stories<br />
I ain't gonna tell you no lies<br />
I saw Albert an hour ago<br />
With a gal named Alice Bly&quot;<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.<br />
<br />
Frankie went down to 12th street<br />
Lookin' up through the window high<br />
She saw her Albert there<br />
Lovin' up Alice Bly<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.<br />
<br>
<br />
Frankie pulled out a pistol<br />
Pulled out a forty-four<br />
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot<br />
And Albert fell on the floor<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.<br />
<br />
Frankie got down upon her knees<br />
Took Albert into her lap<br />
Started to hug and kiss him<br />
But there was no bringin' him back<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gimme a thousand policemen<br />
Throw me into a cell<br />
I shot my Albert dead<br />
And now I'm goin' to hell&quot;<br />
He was my man but he done me wrong.<br />
<br />
Judge said to the jury<br />
&quot;Plain as a thing can be<br />
A woman shot her lover down<br />
Murder in the second degree&quot;<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.<br />
<br />
Frankie went to the scaffold<br />
Calm as a girl could be<br />
Turned her eyes up toward the heavens<br />
Said &quot;Nearer, my God, to Thee&quot;<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong.</p>
