Frankie was a good girl<br />
Everybody knows<br />
Paid one-hundred dollars for Albert's new suit of clothes<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong<br />
<br />
Albert said, "I'm leaving you<br />
Won't be gone for long<br />
Don't wait for me<br />
A-worry about me when I'm gone"<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong<br />
<br />
Frankie went down to the corner saloon<br />
Get a bucket of beer<br />
Said to the bartender<br />
"Has my loving man been here?"<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong<br />
<br />
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no stories<br />
I ain't gonna tell you no lies<br />
I saw Albert an hour ago<br />
With a gal named Alice Bly"<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong<br />
<br />
Frankie went down to 12th Street<br />
Looking up through the window high<br />
She saw her Albert there<br />
Loving up Alice Bly<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong<br />
<br />
<br>
Frankie pulled out a pistol<br />
Pulled out a forty-four<br />
Gun went off a rootie-toot-toot<br />
And Albert fell on the floor<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong<br />
<br />
Frankie got down upon her knees<br />
Took Albert into her lap<br />
Started to hug and kiss him<br />
But there was no bringing him back<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong<br />
<br />
"Gimme a thousand policemen<br />
Throw me into a cell<br />
I shot my Albert dead<br />
And now I'm going to hell<br />
He was my man but he done me wrong"<br />
<br />
Judge said to the jury<br />
"Plain as a thing can be<br />
A woman shot her lover down<br />
Murder in the second degree"<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong<br />
<br />
Frankie went to the scaffold<br />
Calm as a girl could be<br />
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens<br />
Said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee"<br />
He was her man but he done her wrong</p>
