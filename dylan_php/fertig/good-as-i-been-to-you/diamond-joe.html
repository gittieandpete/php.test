Now there's a man you'll hear about<br />
Most anywhere you go<br />
And his holdings are in Texas<br />
And his name is Diamond Joe.<br />
<br />
And he carries all his money<br />
In a diamond-studded jar<br />
He never took much trouble<br />
With the process of the law.<br />
<br />
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys<br />
Did offer him my hand<br />
He gave a string of horses<br />
So old they could not stand.<br />
<br />
And I nearly starved to death, boys<br />
He did mistreat me so<br />
And I never saved a dollar<br />
In the pay of Diamond Joe.<br />
<br>
<br />
Now his bread it was corn dodger<br />
And his meat you couldn't chaw<br />
Nearly drove me crazy<br />
With the waggin'of his jaw.<br />
<br />
And the tellin' of his story<br />
Mean to let you know<br />
That there never was a rounder<br />
That could lie like Diamond Joe.<br />
<br />
Now, I tried three times to quit him<br />
But he did argue so<br />
I'm still punchin' cattle<br />
In the pay of Diamond Joe.<br />
<br />
And when I'm called up yonder<br />
And it's my time to go<br />
Give my blankets to my buddies<br />
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.</p>
