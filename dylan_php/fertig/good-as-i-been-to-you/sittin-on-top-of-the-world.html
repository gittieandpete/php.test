Was in the summer<br />
One early fall<br />
Just tryin' to find my<br />
Little all and all<br />
Now she's gone<br />
An' I don't worry<br />
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world<br />
<br />
Was in the spring<br />
One summer's day<br />
Just when she left me<br />
She gone to stay<br />
Now she's gone<br />
I don't worry<br />
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world<br />
<br />
Now don't come runnin'<br />
Holdin' up your hand<br />
Can't get me a woman<br />
Quick as you can get a man<br />
Now she's gone<br />
An' I don't worry<br />
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world<br />
<br>
<br />
Happen for days<br />
Didn't know your name<br />
Oh, why should I worry?<br />
Or crave you in vain?<br />
Now she's gone<br />
I don't worry<br />
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world<br />
<br />
Went to the station<br />
Down in the yard<br />
Gonna catch me a freight train<br />
Work's done got hard<br />
Now she's gone<br />
An' I don't worry<br />
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world<br />
<br />
The lonesome days<br />
They have gone by<br />
Why should I beg you?<br />
You said good-bye<br />
Now she's gone<br />
I don't worry<br />
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world</p>
