Got a little girl, little and low<br />
She used to love me but she don't no more<br />
She gotta step it up and go - Yeah go<br />
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.<br />
<br />
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs<br />
Make a livin' by puttin' on airs<br />
Gotta step it up and go - Yeah man<br />
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.<br />
<br />
Front door shut, back door too<br />
Blinds pulled down, what'cha gonna do ?<br />
Gotta step it up and go - Yeah go<br />
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.<br />
<br />
Got a little girl, her name is Ball<br />
Give a little bit, she took it all<br />
<br>
I said step it up an' go - Yeah man<br />
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.<br />
<br />
Me an' my baby walkin' down the street<br />
Tellin' everybody 'bout the chief of police<br />
Gotta step it up and go - Yeah go<br />
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.<br />
<br />
Tell my woman I'll see her at home<br />
Ain't no lovin' since she been gone<br />
Gotta step it up and go - Yeah go<br />
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.<br />
<br />
Well, I'll sing this verse, aint gonna sing no more<br />
Hear my gal call me and I got to go<br />
Step it up an' go - Yeah, man<br />
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.</p>
