Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl<br />
She's all in her tender years<br />
She fell in love with a sailor boy<br />
It's true she loved him well<br />
For to go off to sea with him<br />
Like she did not know how<br />
She longed to see that seaport town<br />
Of Canadee-I-O<br />
<br />
So she bargained with the sailor boy<br />
All for a piece of gold<br />
Straightaway then he led her<br />
Down into the hold<br />
Sayin', "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes<br />
Your jacket shall be blue<br />
You'll see that seaport town<br />
Of Canadee-I-O<br />
<br />
Now, when the other sailors heard the news<br />
Well, they fell into a rage<br />
And with all the ship's company<br />
They were willing to engage<br />
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys<br />
Overboard we'll throw her<br />
She'll never see that seaport town<br />
Called Canadee-I-O<br />
<br>
<br />
Now, when the captain he heard the news<br />
Well, he too fell in a rage<br />
And with the whole ship's company<br />
He was willing to engage<br />
Sayin', "She'll stay in sailor's clothes<br />
Her color shall be blue<br />
She'll see that seaport town<br />
Called Canadee-I-O<br />
<br />
Now, when they come down to Canada<br />
Scarcely 'bout half a year<br />
She's married this bold captain<br />
Who called her his dear<br />
She's dressed in silks and satins now<br />
She cuts a gallant show<br />
Finest of the ladies<br />
Down Canadee-I-O<br />
<br />
Come, all you fair and tender girls<br />
Wheresoever you may be<br />
I'd have you to follow your own true love<br />
Whene'er he goes to sea<br />
For if the sailors prove false to you<br />
Well, the captain, he might prove true<br />
You'll see the honor I have gained<br />
By the wearing of the blue</p>
