Frog went a-courtin', and he did ride, uh-huh<br />
Frog went a-courtin', and he did ride, uh-huh<br />
Frog went a-courtin', and he did ride<br />
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Well he rode up to Miss Mousey's door, uh-huh<br />
He rode up to Miss Mousey's door, uh-huh<br />
He rode up to Miss Mousey's door<br />
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Said, "Miss Mouse, are you within?" uh-huh<br />
Said he, "Miss Mouse, are you within?" uh-huh<br />
Said, "Miss Mouse, are you within?"<br />
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin," uh-huh<br />
<br />
He took Miss Mousey on his knee, uh-huh<br />
Took Miss Mousey on his knee, uh-huh<br />
Took Miss Mousey on his knee.<br />
Said, "Miss Mousey, will you marry me?" uh-huh<br />
<br />
"Without my uncle Rat's consent, uh-huh<br />
"Without my uncle Rat's consent, uh-huh<br />
"Without my uncle Rat's consent<br />
I wouldn't marry the president, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh<br />
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh<br />
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides<br />
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Uncle Rat went runnin' downtown, uh-huh<br />
Uncle Rat went runnin' downtown, uh-huh<br />
Uncle Rat went runnin' downtown<br />
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Where shall the wedding supper be? uh-huh<br />
Where shall the wedding supper be? uh-huh<br />
Where shall the wedding supper be?<br />
Way down yonder in a hollow tree, uh-huh<br />
<br />
What should the wedding supper be? uh-huh<br />
What should the wedding supper be? uh-huh<br />
What should the wedding supper be?<br />
Fried mosquito in a black-eye pea, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Well, first to come in was a flyin' moth, uh-huh<br />
First to come in was a flyin' moth, uh-huh<br />
<br>
First to come in was a flyin' moth<br />
She laid out the table cloth, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Next to come in was a juney bug, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a juney bug, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a juney bug<br />
She brought the water jug, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Next to come in was a bumbley bee, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a bumbley bee, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a bumbley bee<br />
Sat mosquito on his knee, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Next to come in was a broken black flea, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a broken black flea, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a broken black flea<br />
Danced a jig with the bumbley bee, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Next to come in was mrs. cow, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was mrs. cow, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was mrs. cow<br />
She tried to dance but she didn't know how, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Next to come in was a little black tick, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a little black tick, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a little black tick<br />
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Next to come in was a big black snake, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a big black snake, uh-huh<br />
Next to come in was a big black snake<br />
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Next to come was the old gray cat, uh-huh<br />
Next to come was the old gray cat, uh-huh<br />
Next to come was the old gray cat<br />
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh<br />
<br />
Mr. Frog went a-hoppin' up over the brook, uh-huh<br />
Mr. Frog went a-hoppin' up over the brook, uh-huh<br />
Mr. Frog went a-hoppin' up over the brook<br />
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh<br />
<br />
A little piece of cornbread layin' on a shelf, uh-huh<br />
A little piece of cornbread layin' on a shelf, uh-huh<br />
A little piece of cornbread layin' on a shelf<br />
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh</p>
