Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride<br />
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside<br />
Mark know what followed and what did betide<br />
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'<br />
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp<br />
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp<br />
And a little wee drummer intending to camp<br />
For the day bein' pleasant and charming.<br />
<br />
"Good morning, good morning," the sergeant he cried<br />
"And the same to you gentleman," we did reply<br />
Intending no harm but means to pass by<br />
For it bein' on Christmas morning<br />
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist<br />
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist<br />
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust<br />
And drink the king's health in the morning.<br />
<br />
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life<br />
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife<br />
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strike<br />
And he always lives pleasant and charmin'<br />
And a soldier he always is decent and clean<br />
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen<br />
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean<br />
And sup on thin gruel in the morning".<br />
<br />
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes<br />
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose<br />
But you're dare not change them one night, for you know<br />
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning<br />
And although that we're single and free<br />
We take great delight in our own company<br />
We have no desire strange places to see<br />
Althoug that your offers are charming.<br />
<br>
<br />
"And we have no desire to take your advance<br />
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance<br />
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France<br />
Where we could get shot without warning"<br />
"Oh no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat<br />
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats<br />
For if you insult me with one other word<br />
I'll cut off your heads in the morning".<br />
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs<br />
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades<br />
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head<br />
And bid them take that as fair warning<br />
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides<br />
We flung them as far as we could in the tide<br />
"Now take them up, devils !" cried Arthur McBride<br />
"And temper their edge in the morning!".<br />
<br />
And the little wee drummer, we flattered his bow<br />
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow<br />
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll<br />
And bade it a tedious returning<br />
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks<br />
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs<br />
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks<br />
And left them for dead in the morning.<br />
<br />
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes<br />
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits<br />
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts<br />
And bid them look sharp in the morning.<br />
<br />
Oh, me and my cousin, one Artur McBride<br />
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside<br />
Mark now what followed and what did betide<br />
For it bein' on Christmas morning.</p>
