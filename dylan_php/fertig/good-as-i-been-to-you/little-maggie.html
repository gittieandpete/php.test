Oh, where is little Maggie ?<br />
Over yonder she stands<br />
Rifle on her shoulder<br />
Six-shooter in her hand.<br />
<br />
How can I ever stand it<br />
Just to see them two blue eyes<br />
Shinin' like some diamonds<br />
Like some diamonds in the sky.<br />
<br />
Rather be in some lonely hollow<br />
Where the sun don't ever shine<br />
Than to see you be another man's darling<br />
And to know that you'll never be mine.<br />
<br />
Well, it's march me away to the station<br />
With my suitcase in my hand<br />
<br>
Yes, march me away to the station<br />
I'm off to some far-distant land.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I have a nickel<br />
And sometimes I have a dime<br />
Sometimes I have ten dollars<br />
Just to pay for little Maggie's wine.<br />
<br />
Pretty flowers are made for blooming<br />
Pretty stars are made to shine<br />
Pretty girls are made for boy's love<br />
Little Maggie was made for mine.<br />
<br />
Well, yonder stands little Maggie<br />
With a dram glass in her hand<br />
She's a-drinkin' down her troubles<br />
Over courtin' some other man.</p>
