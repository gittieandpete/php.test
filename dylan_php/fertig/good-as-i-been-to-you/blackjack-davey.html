Black Jack Davey come a-ridin' on back<br />
A whistlin' loud and merry<br />
Made the woods around him ring<br />
 And he charmed the heart of a lady<br />
Charmed the heart of a lady.<br />
<br />
"How old are you, my pretty little miss<br />
How old are you, my honey ?"<br />
She answered to him with a lovin' smile<br />
"I'll be sixteen come Sunday<br />
Be sixteen come Sunday".<br />
<br />
"Come and go with me, my pretty little miss<br />
Come and go with me, my honey<br />
Take you where the grass grows green<br />
You never will want for money<br />
You never will want for money.<br />
<br />
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes<br />
All made of Spanish leather<br />
Get behind me on my horse<br />
And we'll ride off together<br />
We'll both go off together".<br />
<br />
Well she pulled off them high-heeled shoes<br />
Made of Spanish Leather<br />
Got behind him on his horse<br />
And they rode off together<br />
They both rode off together.<br />
<br />
At night the boss came home<br />
Inquirring about his lady<br />
The servant spoke before she thought<br />
"She's been with Black Jack Davey<br />
Rode off with Black Jack Davey".<br />
<br />
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud<br />
He's speedier than the gray<br />
<br>
I rode all day and I'll ride all night<br />
And I'll overtake my lady<br />
I'll bring back my lady".<br />
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight<br />
Till he came to a river ragin'<br />
And there he spied his darlin' bride<br />
In the arms of Black Jack Davey<br />
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey.<br />
<br />
"Pull off, pull off them long blue gloves<br />
All made of the finest leather<br />
Give to me your lily-white hand<br />
And we'll go home together<br />
We'll both go home together".<br />
<br />
Well, she pulled off them long blue gloves<br />
All made of the finest leather<br />
Gave to him her lily-white hand<br />
And said goodbye forever<br />
Bid farewell forever.<br />
<br />
"Would you forsake your house and home<br />
Would you forsake your baby ?<br />
Would you forsake your husband too<br />
To go with Black Jack Davey<br />
Ride off with Black Jack Davey ?".<br />
<br />
"Well, I'll forsake my house and home<br />
And I'll forsake my baby<br />
I'll forsake my husband too<br />
For the love of Black Jack Davey<br />
Love my Black Jack Davey.<br />
<br />
Last night I slept in a feather bed<br />
Between my husband and baby<br />
Tonight I lay on the river banks<br />
In the arms of Black Jack Davey<br />
Love my Black Jack Davey".</p>
