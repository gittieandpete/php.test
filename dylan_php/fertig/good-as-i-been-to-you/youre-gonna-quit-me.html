You're gonna quit me, baby<br />
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd<br />
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd<br />
Good as I been to you.<br />
<br />
Give you my money, honey<br />
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lawd, Lawd.<br />
<br />
You're gonna quit me, baby<br />
<br>
Put me outta doors, Lawd, Lawd.<br />
<br />
Six months on the chain gang<br />
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lawd, Lawd.<br />
<br />
Jailhouse ain't no plaything<br />
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lawd, Lawd.<br />
<br />
Day you quit me, baby<br />
That's the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.</p>
