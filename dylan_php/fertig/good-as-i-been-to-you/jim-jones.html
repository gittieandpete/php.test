Come and listen for a moment, lads<br />
And hear me tell my tale<br />
How across the sea from England<br />
I was condemned to sail<br />
Now the jury found me guilty<br />
Then says the judge, says he<br />
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you<br />
Across the stormy sea<br />
But take a tip before you ship<br />
To join the iron gang<br />
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay<br />
Or else you'll surely hang<br />
Or else you'll surely hang", says he<br />
"And after that Jim Jones<br />
It's high above on the gallows tree<br />
The crows will pick your bones".<br />
<br />
And our ship was high upon the sea<br />
When pirates came along<br />
But the soldiers on our convict ship<br />
Were full five hundred strong<br />
For they opened fire and somehow drove<br />
That pirate ship away<br />
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship<br />
Than gone to Botany Bay<br />
<br>
With the storms ragin' round us<br />
And the winds a-blowin' gale<br />
I'd rather have drowned in misery<br />
Than gone to New South Wales<br />
There's no time for mischief there they say<br />
Remember that, says they<br />
Or they'll flog the poaching out of you<br />
Down there in Botany Bay.<br />
<br />
Now it's day and night and the irons clang<br />
And like poor galley slaves<br />
We toil and toil, and when we die<br />
Must fill dishonored graves<br />
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains<br />
Well, into the bush I'll go<br />
And I'll join the bravest rankers there<br />
Jack Donohue and co<br />
And some dark night, when everything<br />
Is silent in the town<br />
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all<br />
I'll gun the floggers down<br />
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock<br />
Remember what I say<br />
They'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones<br />
In chains to Botany Bay.</p>
