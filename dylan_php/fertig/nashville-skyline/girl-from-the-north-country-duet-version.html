[Chorus 1: Bob Dylan]<br />
If you're travelin' to the north country fair<br />
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline<br />
Remember me to one who lives there<br />
For she once was a true love of mine<br />
<br />
[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]<br />
See for me that her hair's hangin' down<br />
It curls and falls all down her breast<br />
See for me that her hair's hangin' down<br />
That's the way I remember her best<br />
<br />
[Verse 2: Bob Dylan]<br />
If you go when the snowflakes fall<br />
When the rivers freeze and summer ends<br />
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm<br />
To keep her from the howling winds<br />
<br />
<br>
[Chorus 2: Johnny Cash & Bob Dylan]<br />
If you're travelin' to the north country fair<br />
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline<br />
Please say hello to the one who lives there<br />
For she once was a true love of mine<br />
<br />
If you're travelin' in the north country fair<br />
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline<br />
Remember me to the one who lives there<br />
For she once was a true love of mine<br />
<br />
[Outro: Johnny Cash & Bob Dylan]<br />
A true love of mine<br />
A true love of mine<br />
A true love of mine<br />
A true love of mine<br />
A true love of mine<br />
A true love of mine<br />
She once was a true love of mine</p>
