I once held her in my arms<br />
She said she would always stay<br />
But I was cruel<br />
I treated her like a fool<br />
I threw it all away.<br />
<br />
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand<br />
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day<br />
I must have been mad<br />
I never knew what I had<br />
Until I threw it all away.<br />
<br>
<br />
Love is all there is, it makes the world go around<br />
Love and only love it can't be denied<br />
No matter what you think about it<br />
You just won't be able to do without it<br />
Take a tip from one who's tried.<br />
<br />
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love<br />
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray<br />
For one thing that's certain<br />
You will surely be a-hurtin'<br />
If you throw it all away.</p>
