I have heard rumors all over town<br />
They say that you're planning to put me down<br />
All I would like you to do<br />
Is tell me that it isn't true.<br />
<br />
They say that you've been seen with some other man<br />
That he's tall, dark, and handsome, and you're holding his hand<br />
Darling, I'm a-countin' on you.<br />
Tell me that is isn't true.<br />
<br />
To know that some other man is holdin' you tight<br />
<br>
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.<br />
<br />
All of those awful things that I have heard<br />
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word<br />
So darlin' you better come through<br />
Tell me that it isn't true.<br />
<br />
All of those awful things that I have heard<br />
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word<br />
So darlin' I'm countin' on you<br />
Tell me that it isn't true.</p>
