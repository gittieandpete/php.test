Peggy Day stole my poor heart away<br />
By golly, what more can I say<br />
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.<br />
<br />
Peggy might makes my future look so bright<br />
Man, that girl is ought of sight<br />
Love to spend the day with Peggy night.<br />
<br />
Well, you know that even before I learned her name<br />
You know I loved her just the same <br />
And I tell them all, wherever I may go<br />
<br>
Just so they'll know, that she's my little lady<br />
And I love her so.<br />
<br />
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away<br />
Turned my skies to blue from gray<br />
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.<br />
<br />
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away<br />
By golly, what more can I say<br />
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day<br />
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.</p>
