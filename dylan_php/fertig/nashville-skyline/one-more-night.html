One more night, the stars are in sight<br />
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be<br />
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright<br />
Lighting everything in sight<br />
But tonight no light will shine on me<br />
<br />
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad<br />
I lost the only pal I had<br />
I just could not be what she wanted me to be<br />
I will turn my head up high<br />
<br>
To that dark and rolling sky<br />
For tonight no light will shine on me<br />
<br />
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true<br />
I had no idea what a woman in love would do<br />
<br />
One more night, I will wait for the light<br />
While the wind blows high above the tree<br />
Oh, I miss my darling so<br />
I didn't mean to see her go<br />
But tonight no light will shine on me</p>
