Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair,<br />
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,<br />
Remember me to one who lives there.<br />
She once was a true love of mine.<br />
<br />
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,<br />
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,<br />
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,<br />
To keep her from the howlin' winds.<br />
<br />
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,<br />
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.<br />
<br>
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,<br />
That's the way i remember her best.<br />
<br />
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.<br />
Many times i've often prayed<br />
In the darkness of my night,<br />
In the brightness of my day.<br />
<br />
So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,<br />
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,<br />
Remember me to one who lives there.<br />
She once was a true love of mine.<br />
