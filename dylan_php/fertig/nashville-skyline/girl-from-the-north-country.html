If you're traveling in the north country fair<br />
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline<br />
Remember me to one who lives there<br />
For she was once a true love of mine.<br />
<br />
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm<br />
When the rivers freeze and summer ends<br />
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm<br />
To keep her from the howlin' winds.<br />
<br />
Please see from me if her hair hanging down<br />
If it curls and flows all down her breast<br />
<br>
Please see from me if her hair hanging down<br />
That's the way I remember her best.<br />
<br />
Well, if you're traveling in the north country fair<br />
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline<br />
Please say hello to one who lives there<br />
She once was a true love of mine.<br />
<br />
If you're travelin' in the north country fair<br />
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline<br />
Remember me to one who lives there<br />
She once was a true love of mine.</p>
