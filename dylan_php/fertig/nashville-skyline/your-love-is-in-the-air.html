You're the one that never lets me sleep<br />
To my mind, down to my soul you touch my lips<br />
You're the one that I can't wait to see<br />
With you here by my side I'm in ecstasy<br />
<br />
I am all alone without you<br />
My days are dark without a glimpse of you<br />
But now that you came into my life<br />
I feel complete<br />
The flowers bloom, my morning shines<br />
And I can see<br />
<br />
Chorus:<br />
Your love is like the sun<br />
That lights up my whole world<br />
I feel the warmth inside<br />
Your love is like the river<br />
That flows down through my veins<br />
I feel the chill inside<br />
<br>
<br />
Every time I hear our music play<br />
Reminds me of the things that we've been through<br />
In my mind I can't believe it's true<br />
But in my heart the reality is you<br />
<br />
I am all alone without you<br />
My days are dark without a glimpse of you<br />
But now that you came into my life<br />
I feel complete<br />
The flowers bloom, my morning shines<br />
And I can see<br />
<br />
Your love is like the sun<br />
That lights up my whole world<br />
I feel the warmth inside<br />
Your love is like the river<br />
That flows down through my veins<br />
I feel the chill inside</p>
