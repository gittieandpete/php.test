To be alone with you<br />
Just you and me<br />
Now won't you tell me the true<br />
Ain't that the way it oughta be?<br />
To hold each other tight<br />
The whole night through<br />
Ev'rything is always right<br />
When I'm alone with you.<br />
<br />
To be alone with you<br />
At the close of the day<br />
With only you in view<br />
While evenings slips away<br />
It only goes to show<br />
That while life's pleasures be few<br />
<br>
The only one I know<br />
Is when I'm alone with you.<br />
<br />
They say that nighttime is the right time<br />
To be with the one you love<br />
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day<br />
But you're always what I'm thinkin' of<br />
I wish the night were here<br />
Bringin' me all of your charms<br />
When only you are near<br />
To hold me in your arms.<br />
<br />
I'll always thank the Lord<br />
When my working day's through<br />
I get my sweet reward<br />
To be alone with you.</p>
