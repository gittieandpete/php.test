There was a little girl, I used to know her<br />
I still think about her, time to time<br />
There was a moment when I really loved her<br />
Then one day, the feeling just died<br />
Chorus<br />
We went straight into darkness<br />
Out over the line<br />
Yeah straight into darkness<br />
Straight into night<br />
I remember flying out to London<br />
I remember the feeling at the time<br />
Out the window of the 747<br />
<br>
Man there was nothin', only black sky<br />
(Repeat Chorus)<br />
Oh give it up to me, I need it<br />
Girl, I know a good thing when I see it<br />
Baby wrong or right, I mean it --<br />
I don't believe the good times are over<br />
I don't believe the thrill is all gone<br />
Real love is a man's salvation<br />
The weak ones fall the strong carry on<br />
Straight into darkness<br />
Out over the line<br />
Yeah straight into darkness<br />
Straight into night</p>
