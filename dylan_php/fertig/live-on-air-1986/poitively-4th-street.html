You've got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend<br />
When I was down you just stood there grinnin'<br />
You've got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend<br />
You just want to be on the side that's winnin' You say I let you down, ya know its not like that<br />
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?<br />
You say you've lost your faith, but that's not where its at<br />
You have no faith to lose, and ya know it I know the reason, that you talked behind my back<br />
I used to be among the crowd you're in with<br />
Do you take me for such a fool, to think I'd make contact<br />
<br>
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with? You see me on the street, you always act surprised<br />
You say "how are you?", "good luck", but ya don't mean it<br />
When you know as well as me, you'd rather see me paralyzed<br />
Why don't you just come out once and scream it No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace<br />
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them<br />
And tho I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place<br />
Don't you understand, its not my problem? I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes<br />
And just for that one moment I could be you<br />
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes<br />
You'd know what a drag it is to see you</p>
