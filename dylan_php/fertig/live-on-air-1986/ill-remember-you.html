I'll remember you<br />
When I've forgotten all the rest<br />
You to me were true<br />
You to me were the best<br />
When there is no more<br />
You cut to the core<br />
Quicker than anyone I knew<br />
When I'm all alone<br />
In the great unknown<br />
I'll remember you.<br />
<br />
I'll remember you<br />
At the end of the trail<br />
I had so much left to do<br />
I had so little time to fail<br />
There's some people that<br />
You don't forget<br />
Even though you've only seen 'em<br />
One time or two<br />
<br>
When the roses fade<br />
And I'm in the shade<br />
I'll remember you.<br />
<br />
Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?<br />
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?<br />
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you<br />
With the rain blowing in your hair.<br />
<br />
I'll remember you<br />
When the wind blows through the piny wood<br />
It was you who came right through<br />
It was you who understood<br />
Though I'd never say<br />
That I done it the way<br />
That you'd have liked me to<br />
In the end<br />
My dear sweet friend<br />
I'll remember you.</p>
