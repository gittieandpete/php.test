That big eight-wheeler, rollin' down the track<br />
Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back<br />
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone<br />
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky<br />
<br />
So I'm movin' on.<br />
Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br />
Movin' on, movin' on<br />
Oooh, ooh,<br />
I'm movin' on<br />
<br />
But someday baby, when you've had your way<br />
You'll want your daddy, but your daddy will say<br />
I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on.<br />
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky<br />
I'm movin' on.<br />
Oooh ...<br />
<br />
Mister fireman, better listen to me<br />
<br>
I got a pretty mama in Tennessee<br />
I'm movin' on, I'm a-rollin' on<br />
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue<br />
I'm movin' on.<br />
Oooh...<br />
<br />
See that big eight-wheeler, rollin' down the track<br />
Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back<br />
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone<br />
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue<br />
I'm movin' on.<br />
Oooh...<br />
<br />
That big loud whistle, as it blew and blew<br />
Said hello to the southland, We're comin' to you<br />
And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song<br />
You had the laugh on me, so I set you free<br />
And I'm movin' on.<br />
Oooh...</p>
