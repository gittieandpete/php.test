Everybody wants to know why he couldn't adjust<br />
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?<br />
He was a clean-cut kid<br />
But they made a killer out of him,<br />
That's what they did<br />
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is<br />
They put ideas in his head he thought were his<br />
He was a clean-cut kid<br />
But they made a killer out of him,<br />
That's what they did<br />
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band<br />
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand<br />
He was a clean-cut kid<br />
But they made a killer out of him,<br />
That's what they did<br />
He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout<br />
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out<br />
He was a clean-cut kid<br />
But they made a killer out of him,<br />
That's what they did<br />
They said, "Listen boy, you're just a pup"<br />
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up<br />
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,<br />
A jeep to drive, blood to spill<br />
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes"<br />
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes<br />
He was a clean-cut kid<br />
But they made a killer out of him,<br />
<br>
That's what they did<br />
He bought the American dream but it put him in debt<br />
The only game he could play was Russian roulette<br />
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,<br />
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed<br />
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole<br />
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool<br />
They took a clean-cut kid<br />
And they made a killer out of him,<br />
That's what they did<br />
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar<br />
Could've been an accountant or a tennis star<br />
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day<br />
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay<br />
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans<br />
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own<br />
They took a clean-cut kid<br />
And they made a killer out of him,<br />
That's what they did<br />
Well, everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust<br />
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust<br />
They took his head and turned it inside out<br />
He never did know what it was all about<br />
He had a steady job, he joined the choir<br />
He never did plan to walk the high wire<br />
They took a clean-cut kid<br />
And they made a killer out of him,<br />
That's what they did</p>
