The water is wide and I can't cross over<br />
Neither have I wings that I could fly<br />
Build me a boat that can carry two<br />
And both shall row my love and I<br />
<br />
There is a ship and it sails on the sea<br />
Loaded deep as deep can be<br />
But not as deep as the love I'm in<br />
I know not if I sink or swim<br />
<br>
<br />
I leaned my back up against an oak<br />
Thinkin' it was a trusty tree<br />
But first it bent and then it broke<br />
Just like my own false love to me<br />
<br />
Oh love is gentle, love is kind<br />
Gay as a jewel when first it's new<br />
But love grows old and waxes cold<br />
And fades away like some morning dew</p>
