(first release<br />
<br />
Well i don't know why i love you like i do<br />
Nobody in the world can get along with you.<br />
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den<br />
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in.<br />
<br />
Well sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be<br />
When you get a crazy notion of jumpin' all over me<br />
Well you give me the blues i guess you're satisfied<br />
An' you give me the blues i wanna lay down and die.<br />
<br />
<br>
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama<br />
I helped you when you had no food to eat.<br />
You're the kind of woman i just don't understand<br />
You're takin' all my money and give it to another man.<br />
<br />
Well you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brain<br />
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane<br />
You give me the blues, i guess you're satisfied<br />
You give me the blues, i wanna lay down and die<br />
<br />
Well you give me the blues, i wanna lay down and die<br />
