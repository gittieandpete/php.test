Well, I dont know why I love you like I do<br />
Nobody in the world can get along with you<br />
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den<br />
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in.<br />
<br />
Oh sometimes you're as sweet as nobody want to be<br />
Oh when you get the crazy notion of jumping all over me<br />
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied<br />
When you give me the blues I wanna lay down and die.<br />
<br>
<br />
After when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama<br />
After when you had no food to eat<br />
Now you're that kind of woman that just don't understand<br />
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.<br />
<br />
Well, you're that kind of woman makes a man lose his brains<br />
You're that kind of woman drives me insane<br />
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied<br />
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.</p>
