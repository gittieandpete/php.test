Well there's one kind of flavor I'll ask for you<br />
Well there's one kind of flavor I'll ask for you<br />
There's just one kind of flavor I'll ask for you<br />
You can see that my grave is kept clean.<br />
<br />
And there's two white horses following me<br />
And there's two white horses following me<br />
I got two white horses following me<br />
Waiting on my burying ground.<br />
<br />
Did you ever hear that coffin sound<br />
Did you ever hear that coffin sound<br />
Did you ever hear that coffin sound<br />
Means another poor boy is under the ground.<br />
<br>
<br />
Did you ever hear them church bells toll<br />
Did you ever hear them church bells toll<br />
Did you ever hear them church bells toll<br />
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.<br />
<br />
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold<br />
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold<br />
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold<br />
And I believe what the father told.<br />
<br />
And there's one last flavor I'll ask for you<br />
And there's one last flavor I'll ask for you<br />
And just one last flavor I'll ask for you<br />
You can see that my grave is kept clean.</p>
