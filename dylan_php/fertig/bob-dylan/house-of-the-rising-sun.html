There is a house down in New Orleans they call the rising sun<br />
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me, oh God, I'm one<br />
My mother was a tailor, she sewed these new blue jeans<br />
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans<br />
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk<br />
And the only time when he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk<br />
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around<br />
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town<br />
<br>
<br />
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done<br />
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the rising sun<br />
Well, with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train<br />
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain<br />
I'm going back to New Orleans, my race is almost run<br />
I'm going back to end my life down in the rising sun<br />
There is a house in New Orleans they call the rising sun<br />
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me, oh God, I'm one</p>
