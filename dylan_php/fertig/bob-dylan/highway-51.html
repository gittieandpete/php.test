(first release<br />
<br />
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door<br />
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door<br />
But won't get the girl i'm loving<br />
Won't go down highway 51 no more.<br />
<br />
Well, i know that highway like i know my hand<br />
Yes, i know that highway like i know the back of my hand<br />
Running from up wisconsin<br />
Way down to no man's land.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, if i should die before my time should come<br />
And if i should die before my time should come<br />
Won't you bury my body<br />
Out on highway 51?<br />
<br />
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door<br />
I said, highway 51 runs right by my baby's door<br />
But won't get the girl i'm loving<br />
Won't go down highway 51 no more.<br />
