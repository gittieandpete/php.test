I am a man of constant sorrow<br />
I've seen trouble all my days<br />
I'll say goodbye to Colorado <br />
Where I was born and partly raised.<br />
<br />
 Your mother says I'm a stranger <br />
My face you'll never see no more<br />
But there's one promise, darling: <br />
I'll see you on God's golden shore.<br />
<br>
<br />
Through this open world I'm about to trouble <br />
Through ice and snows, sleet and rain<br />
I'm about to ride that morning railroad<br />
Perhaps I'll die on that train.<br />
<br />
I'm going back to Colorado <br />
The place that I started from<br />
If I had known how bad you'd treat me honey <br />
I never would have come.</p>
