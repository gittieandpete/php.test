I was born in Dixie in a boomer shed<br />
Just a little shanty by the railroad track<br />
Freight train was it taught me how to cry<br />
The holler of the driver was my lullaby<br />
I got the freight train blues<br />
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes<br />
And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know<br />
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.<br />
<br />
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha<br />
She was the only daugther of an enginer<br />
<br>
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke<br />
Seems a waste to get a good man broke<br />
I got the freight train blues<br />
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes<br />
And when the whistle blows I gotta go mama, don't you know<br />
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.<br />
<br />
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again<br />
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train<br />
Every place I wanna go I never can go<br />
Because you know I got the freight train blues<br />
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes.</p>
