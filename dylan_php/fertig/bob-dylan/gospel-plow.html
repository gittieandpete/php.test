Mary wore three links of chain <br />
Every link was Jesus name<br />
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on<br />
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.<br />
<br />
Mary, Mark, Luke and John <br />
All these prophets so good and gone<br />
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on<br />
<br>
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.v <br />
Well, I never been to heaven <br />
But I've been told streets up there <br />
Are lined with gold<br />
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on<br />
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.<br />
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.<br />
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.</p>
