Rambling out of the wild west<br />
Leaving the towns I love best<br />
Thought I'd seen some ups and down <br />
'Till I come into New York town<br />
People going down to the ground<br />
Building going up to the sky.<br />
<br />
Wintertime in New York town<br />
The wind blowing snow around<br />
Walk around with nowhere to go <br />
Somebody could freeze right to the bone<br />
I froze right to the bone <br />
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years <br />
I didn't feel so cold then.<br />
<br />
I swung on to my old guitar <br />
Grabbed hold of a subway car<br />
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride<br />
I landed up on the downtown side: <br />
Greenwich Village.<br />
<br />
I walked down there and ended up <br />
In one of them coffee-houses on the block<br />
Got on the stage to sing and play <br />
Man there said, Come back some other day<br />
You sound like a hillbilly <br />
We want folksingers here.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, I got a harmonica job begun to play <br />
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day<br />
I blowed inside out and upside down <br />
The man there said he loved my sound<br />
He was raving about he loved my sound <br />
Dollar a day's worth.<br />
<br />
After weeks and weeks of hanging around <br />
I finally got a job in New York town<br />
In a bigger place, bigger money too <br />
Even joined the Union and paid my dues.<br />
<br />
Now, a very great man once said <br />
That some people rob you with a fountain pen<br />
It don't take too long to find out <br />
Just what he was talking about<br />
A lot of people don't have much food on their table<br />
But they got a lot of forks and knives <br />
And they gotta cut something.<br />
<br />
So one morning when the sun was warm <br />
I rambled out of New York town<br />
Pulled my cap down over my eyes <br />
And heated out for the western skies<br />
So long New York <br />
Howdy, East Orange.</p>
