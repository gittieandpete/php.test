Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door<br />
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door<br />
If I don't get the girl I'm loving<br />
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.<br />
<br />
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand<br />
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand<br />
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, if I should die before my time should come<br />
And if I should die before my time should come<br />
Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51.<br />
<br />
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door<br />
I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door<br />
If I don't get the girl I'm loving<br />
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.</p>
