Feeling funny in my mind, Lord, <br />
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die<br />
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord <br />
I believe I'm fixing to die<br />
Well, I don't mind dying <br />
But I hate to leave my children crying<br />
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground<br />
Look over yonder to that burying ground<br />
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord, <br />
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die<br />
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord <br />
I believe I'm fixing to die<br />
<br>
Well, I don't mind dying but <br />
I hate to leave my children crying<br />
There's a black smoke rising, Lord <br />
It's rising up above my head, up above my head<br />
It's rising up above my head, up above my head<br />
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.<br />
<br />
I'm walking kind of funny, Lord <br />
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die<br />
Yes I'm walking kind of funny, Lord <br />
I believe I'm fixing to die<br />
Fixing to die, fixing to die<br />
Well, I don't mind dying <br />
But I hate to leave my children crying.</p>
