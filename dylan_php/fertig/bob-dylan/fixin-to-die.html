(first release<br />
<br />
Feeling funny in my mind, lord,<br />
I believe i'm fixing to die<br />
Feeling funny in my mind, lord<br />
I believe i'm fixing to die<br />
Well, i don't mind dying<br />
But i hate to leave my children crying<br />
Well, i look over yonder to that burying ground<br />
Look over yonder to that burying ground<br />
Sure seems lonesome, lord, when the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Feeling funny in my eyes, lord,<br />
I believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die<br />
Feeling funny in my eyes, lord<br />
<br>
I believe i'm fixing to die<br />
Well, i don't mind dying but<br />
I hate to leave my children crying<br />
There's a black smoke rising, lord<br />
It's rising up above my head, up above my head<br />
It's rising up above my head, up above my head<br />
And tell jesus make up my dying bed.<br />
<br />
I'm walking kind of funny, lord<br />
I believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die<br />
Yes i'm walking kind of funny, lord<br />
I believe i'm fixing to die<br />
Fixing to die, fixing to die<br />
Well, i don't mind dying<br />
But i hate to leave my children crying.<br />
