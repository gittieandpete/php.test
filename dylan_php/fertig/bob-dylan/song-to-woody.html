I'm out here a thousand miles from my home<br />
Walking a road other men have gone down<br />
I'm seeing a new world of people and things<br />
Hear paupers and peasants and princes and kings.<br />
<br />
Hey hey Woody Guthrie I wrote you a song<br />
About a funny old world that's coming along<br />
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn<br />
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.<br />
<br />
Hey Woody Guthrie but I know that you know<br />
All the things that I'm saying and a many times more<br />
<br>
I'm singing you the song but I can't you sing enough<br />
'Cause there's not many men that've done the things that you've done.<br />
<br />
Here's to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too<br />
And to all the good people that travelled with you<br />
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men<br />
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.<br />
<br />
I'm leaving tomorrow but I could leave today<br />
Somewhere down the road someday<br />
The very last thing that I'd want to do<br />
Is to say I've been hitting some hard travelling too.</p>
