I wandered again to my home in the mountain<br />
Where in youth's early days I was happy and free<br />
I looked for my friends but I never could find them<br />
I found they were all rank strangers to me.<br />
<br />
Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger<br />
No mother or dad not a friend could I see<br />
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces<br />
I found they were all rank strangers to me.<br />
<br>
<br />
They all moved a way, said a voice of a stranger<br />
"To that bautiful home by the bright crystal sea"<br />
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven<br />
Where no one will be a stranger to me.<br />
<br />
Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger<br />
No mother or dad not a friend could I see<br />
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces<br />
I found they were all rank strangers to me.</p>
