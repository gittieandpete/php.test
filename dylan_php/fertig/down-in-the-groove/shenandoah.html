Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you<br />
Look away, you rollin' river<br />
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear <br />
Look away, we're bound away<br />
Across the wide Missouri.<br />
<br />
Now the Missouri is a mighty river<br />
Look away, you rollin' river<br />
Indians camp a long her border<br />
Look away, we're bound away<br />
Across the wide Missouri.<br />
<br />
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden<br />
Look away, you rollin' river<br />
With notions his canoe was laden<br />
Look away, we're bound away<br />
Across the wide Missouri.<br />
<br>
<br />
Shenandoah, I love your daughter<br />
Look away, you rollin' river<br />
It was for her I'd cross the water<br />
Look away, we're bound away<br />
Across the wide Missouri.<br />
<br />
For seven long years I courted Sally<br />
Look away, you rollin' river<br />
Seven more years I longed to have her<br />
Look away, we're bound away<br />
Across the wide Missouri.<br />
<br />
Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you<br />
Look away, you rollin' river<br />
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you<br />
Look away, we're bound away<br />
Across the wide Missouri.</p>
