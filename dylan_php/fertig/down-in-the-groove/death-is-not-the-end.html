When you're sad and when you're lonely<br />
And you haven't got a friend<br />
Just remember that death is not the end<br />
And all that you held sacred<br />
Falls down and dows not bend<br />
Just remember that death is not the end.<br />
<br />
Not the end, not the end<br />
Just remember that death is not the end.<br />
<br />
When you're standing on the cross-roads<br />
That you cannot comprehend<br />
Just remember that death is not the end<br />
And all your dreams have vanished<br />
And you don't know what's up the bend<br />
Just remember that death is not the end.<br />
<br />
Not the end, not the end<br />
Just remember that death is not the end.<br />
<br />
When the storm clouds gather round you<br />
<br>
And heavy rains descend<br />
Just remember that death is not the end<br />
And there's nowhere there to comfort you<br />
With helping hand to lend<br />
Just remember that death is not the end.<br />
<br />
Not the end, not the end<br />
Just remember that death is not the end.<br />
<br />
Oh the tree of life is growing<br />
Where the spirit never dies<br />
And the bright light of salvation<br />
Shines in dark and empty skies<br />
When the cities are on fire<br />
When the burning flesh of men<br />
Just remember that death is not the end<br />
And you search in vain to find<br />
Just one law abiding citizen<br />
Just remember that death is not the end.<br />
<br />
Not the end, not the end<br />
Just remember that death is not the end.</p>
