Look who's back in town<br />
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown<br />
All you boys better run for cover<br />
If you don't a-wanna be a hearted broken lover.<br />
<br />
See her in that very tight skirt<br />
Got what it takes <br />
Just to make you hurt<br />
Don't you see by those big bright eyes<br />
Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies.<br />
<br />
Makes no difference where she's been<br />
I'm go in south and doin' them things again<br />
Bake in a hot tub, down the line<br />
I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine.<br />
<br />
<br>
I'll go see them come down my way<br />
Like a fool you're gonna hear me say:<br />
"I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown<br />
Please let me love you, baby<br />
Don't put me down".<br />
