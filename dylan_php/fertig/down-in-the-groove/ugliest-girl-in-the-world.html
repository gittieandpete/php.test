Well the woman that I love she got a hook in her nose<br />
Her eye brows meet she wears second hand clothes <br />
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop<br />
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop.<br />
You know I love her yeah I love her<br />
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.<br />
<br />
If I ever lose her I will go in sane <br />
I go half crazy when she calls my name<br />
When she says ' ba-ba ba-ba baby I love you <br />
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.<br />
You know I love her yeah I love her<br />
I'm in love in the ugliest girl in the world.<br />
<br />
The woman that I love she got two flat feet<br />
Her knees knocks together walking down the street<br />
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed<br />
<br>
She ain't much to look at but like I said: <br />
You know I love her Yeah I love her<br />
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world<br />
<br />
I don't mean to say she got nothing going<br />
She got a weird sense of humor that is all her own<br />
When I got low she sets me on my feet<br />
Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet.<br />
You know I love her Yeah I love her<br />
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.<br />
<br />
Well the woman that I love she got a hook in her nose<br />
Her eye brows meet she wears second hand clothes <br />
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop<br />
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop.<br />
You know I love her yeah I love her<br />
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.</p>
