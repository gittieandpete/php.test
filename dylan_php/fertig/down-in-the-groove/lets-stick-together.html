Well, a young marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred<br />
The man put us together, now, you wanna make it<br />
Stick together<br />
Come on, come on, stick together.<br />
<br />
You know, you made a vow, not to leave one another, never<br />
Well, ya never miss you water till your well runs dry<br />
Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together<br />
Come on, come on, stick together<br />
We made a vow, not to leave one another, never.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, ya never miss your water till your well runs dry<br />
Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together<br />
Come on, come on, stick together<br />
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never.<br />
<br />
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child<br />
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy<br />
Let's stick together<br />
Come on, come on, stick together<br />
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never.</p>
