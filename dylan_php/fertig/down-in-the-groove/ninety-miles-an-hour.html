I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun<br />
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done<br />
Instead of stopping when we could we went right on <br />
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.<br />
<br />
You belong to someone else, and I do too<br />
It's just crazy bein' here with you<br />
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat<br />
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street<br />
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.<br />
<br />
I didn't want to want you, but now I have no choice<br />
It's too late to listen to that warning voice<br />
All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat<br />
<br>
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street<br />
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.<br />
<br />
You're not free to belong to me<br />
And you know I could never be your own<br />
Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine<br />
But we're heading for a wall of stone.<br />
<br />
Warning signs are flashing ev'ry where, but we pay no heed<br />
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a pickin' up speed<br />
Disaster's getting closer ev'ry time we meet<br />
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street<br />
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street<br />
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.</p>
