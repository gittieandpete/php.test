When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
And all that you've held sacred, falls down and does not mend <br />
Just remember that death is no the end <br />
Not the end, not the end <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
<br />
When you're standing at the crossroads that you cannot comprehend <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
Not the end, not the end <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
<br />
When the storm clouds gather 'round you, and heavy rains descend <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
<br>
And there's no one there to comfort you, with a helpin' hand to lend <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
Not the end, not the end <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
<br />
Oh, the tree of life is growing <br />
Where the spirit never dies <br />
And the bright light of salvation shines <br />
In dark and empty skies <br />
<br />
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen <br />
Just remember that death is not the end <br />
Not the end, not the end <br />
Just remember that death is not the end</p>
