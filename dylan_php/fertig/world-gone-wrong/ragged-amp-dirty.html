Lord I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too<br />
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too<br />
If I clean up sweet mama, can I stay all night with you.<br />
<br />
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds<br />
Went to my window, babe I couldn't see through my blinds<br />
Heard my best friend coming around I thought I heard my baby cry.<br />
<br />
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby then just let me sit down in your door<br />
If I can't come in here baby then just let me sit down in your door<br />
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.<br />
<br>
<br />
How can I live here baby, Lord, and feel at ease ?<br />
How can I live here baby, Lord, and feel at ease ?<br />
Well, that woman I got, man, she do just what she feels.<br />
<br />
Lord you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild<br />
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild<br />
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.<br />
<br />
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blind<br />
Leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blinds<br />
Well, I've been mistreated and I swear, I don't mind dyin'.</p>
