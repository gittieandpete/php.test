Feel like a broke down engine ain't got no drivin' wheel<br />
Feel like a broke down engine ain't got no drivin' wheel<br />
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.<br />
<br />
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke<br />
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke<br />
I done pawned my pistol baby, my best clothes been sold.<br />
<br />
Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy<br />
Lordy Lord.<br />
<br />
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees<br />
Went down to my praying ground, fell on my bended knees<br />
I ain't cryin' for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.<br />
<br />
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more<br />
<br>
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more<br />
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.<br />
<br />
Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy<br />
Lordy Lord.<br />
<br />
Can't you hear me baby, rappin' on your door ?<br />
Can't you hear me baby, rappin' on your door ?<br />
Now you hear me tappin', tappin' across your floor. <br />
<br />
Feel like a broke down engine, ain't got no drive at all<br />
Feel like a broke down engine, ain't got no drive at all<br />
What made me love my woman, she can really do the Georgia Crawl.<br />
<br />
Feel like a broke down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell<br />
Feel like a broke down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell<br />
If you're a real hot momma, come take away Daddy's weeping spell.</p>
