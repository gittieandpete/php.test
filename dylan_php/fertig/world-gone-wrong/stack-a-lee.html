Hawlin alley on a dark and drizzly night,<br />
Billy lyons and stack-a-lee had one terrible fight.<br />
All about that john b. stetson hat.<br />
Stack-a-lee walked to the bar-room, and he called for a glass of beer,<br />
Turned around to billy lyons, said, "what are you doin' here?"<br />
"waitin' for a train, please bring my woman home.<br />
"stack-a-lee, oh stack-a-lee. please don't take my life.<br />
Got three little children and a-weepin', lovin' wife.<br />
You're a bad man, bad man, stack-a-lee."<br />
"god bless your children and I'll take care of your wife.<br />
You stole my john b., now I'm bound to take your life."<br />
All about that john b. stetson hat.<br />
Stack-a-lee turned to billy lyons and he shot him right through the head,<br />
Only taking one shot to kill billy lyons dead.<br />
All about that john b. stetson hat.<br />
Sent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come,<br />
<br>
Just pointed out stack-a-lee, said, "now what have you done?"<br />
You're a bad man, bad man, stack-a-lee."<br />
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack,<br />
Taking him to the cemetery, buy they failed to bring him back.<br />
All about that john b. stetson hat.<br />
Hawlin alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark.<br />
It must have been old stack-a-lee stumbling in the dark.<br />
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.<br />
High police walked on to stack-a-lee, he was lying fast asleep.<br />
High police walked on to stack-a-lee, and he jumped forty feet.<br />
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.<br />
Well they got old stack-a-lee and they laid him right back in jail.<br />
Couldn't get a man around to go stack-a lee's bail<br />
All about that john b. stetson hat.<br />
Stack-a-lee turned to the jailer, he said, "jailer, I can't sleep.<br />
'round my bedside billy lyons began to creep."<br />
All about that john b. stetson hat.</p>
