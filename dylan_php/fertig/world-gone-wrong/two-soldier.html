He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy <br />
His voice was low with pain <br />
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine <br />
If I ride back again <br />
<br />
But if you ride back and I am left <br />
You'll do as much for me <br />
Mother, you know, must hear the news <br />
So write to her tenderly <br />
<br />
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint <br />
Her fond face pale with woe <br />
Her heart will be broken when I am gone <br />
I'll see her soon, I know." <br />
<br />
Just then the order came to charge <br />
For an instance hand touched hand <br />
They said, "Aye," and away they rode <br />
That brave and devoted band <br />
<br>
 <br />
Straight was the track to the top of the hill <br />
The rebels they shot and shelled <br />
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks <br />
And guarded them as they fell <br />
<br />
There soon came a horrible dying yell <br />
From heights that they could not gain <br />
And those whom doom and death had spared <br />
Rode slowly back again <br />
<br />
But among the dead that were left on the hill <br />
Was the boy with the curly hair <br />
The tall dark man who rode by his side <br />
Lay dead beside him there <br />
<br />
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl <br />
The words that her lover had said <br />
Momma, you know, awaits the news <br />
And she'll only know he's dead</p>
