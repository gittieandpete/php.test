Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around<br />
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
 <br />
Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West<br />
When she returned, little Delia'd gone to rest.<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
<br />
Delia's Daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned<br />
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
<br />
Curtis's looking high, Curtis's looking low<br />
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
<br />
High upon the housetops, high as I can see<br />
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
<br />
Men in Atlanta, trying to pass for white<br />
<br>
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
<br />
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about ?"<br />
"All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
Curtis said to the judge "What might be my fine ?"<br />
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
Curtis' in the jailhouse, drinking from an old tin cup<br />
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up. <br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
<br />
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be ?<br />
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.<br />
<br />
Delia, oh Delia, how could it be ?<br />
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.<br />
<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone.</p>
