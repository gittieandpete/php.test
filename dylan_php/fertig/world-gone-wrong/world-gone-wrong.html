Strange things have happened like never before<br />
My baby told me I would have to go<br />
I can't be good no more, once like I did before<br />
I can't be good, baby <br />
Honey, because the world gone wrong.<br />
<br />
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home<br />
No use in worrying cause the world gone wrong<br />
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br />
I can't be good baby <br />
Honey, because the world gone wrong.<br />
<br />
I told you baby, right to your head<br />
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead<br />
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br />
I can't be good baby <br />
Honey, cause the world gone wrong.<br />
<br />
I tried to be lovin', and treat you kind<br />
But it seem like you never right, you got no loyal mind<br />
<br>
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br />
I can't be good baby <br />
Honey, cause the world's gone wrong.<br />
<br />
If you had a woman and she don't treat you kind<br />
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind<br />
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br />
I can't be good baby<br />
Honey, because the world gone wrong.<br />
<br />
Said, when you been good now, can't do no more<br />
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door"<br />
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br />
I can't be good baby<br />
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.<br />
<br />
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat<br />
No use to ask me baby, cause I'll never be back<br />
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br />
I can't be good baby. <br />
Honey, because the world gone wrong.</p>
