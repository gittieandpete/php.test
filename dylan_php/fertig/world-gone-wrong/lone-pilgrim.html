I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay<br />
And patiently stood by his tomb<br />
Went in a low whisper I heard something say:<br />
How sweetly I sleep here alone.<br />
<br />
The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar<br />
And gathering storms may arise<br />
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul<br />
The tears are all wiped from my eyes.<br />
<br>
<br />
The call of my master compelled me from home<br />
No kindred or relative nigh<br />
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb<br />
My soul flew to mansion on high.<br />
<br />
Go tell my companion and children most dear<br />
To weep not for me now I'm gone<br />
The same hand that led me through seas most severe<br />
Has kindly assisting me home.</p>
