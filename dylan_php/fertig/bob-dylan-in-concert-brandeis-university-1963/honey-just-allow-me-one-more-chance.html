Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
To get along with you<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
Ah'll do anything with you<br />
Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road<br />
With my head in my hand<br />
I'm lookin' for a woman<br />
Needs a worried man<br />
Just-a one kind favor I ask you<br />
'Low me just-a one more chance<br />
<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
To ride your aeroplane<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
To ride your passenger train<br />
Well, I've been lookin' all over<br />
<br>
For a gal like you<br />
I can't find nobody<br />
So you'll have to do<br />
Just-a one kind favor I ask you<br />
'Low me just-a one more chance<br />
<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
To get along with you<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
Ah'll do anything with you<br />
Well, lookin' for a woman<br />
That ain't got no man<br />
Is just lookin' for a needle<br />
That is lost in the sand<br />
Just-a one kind favor I ask you<br />
'Low me just-a one more chance</p>
