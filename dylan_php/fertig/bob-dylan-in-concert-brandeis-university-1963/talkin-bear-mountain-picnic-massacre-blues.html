[Verse 1]<br />
I saw it advertised one day<br />
Bear mountain picnic was coming my way<br />
"come along 'n' take a trip<br />
We'll bring you up there on a ship<br />
Bring the wife and kids<br />
Bring the whole family"<br />
Yippee!<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Well, I run right down 'n' bought a ticket<br />
To this bear mountain picnic<br />
But little did I realize<br />
I was in for a picnic surprise<br />
Had nothing to do with mountains<br />
I didn't even come close to a bear<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier<br />
Six thousand people there<br />
Everybody had ticket for the trip<br />
"oh well." I said, "it's a pretty big ship<br />
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier"<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Well, we all got on 'n' what do you think<br />
That big old boat started to sink<br />
More people kept a-piling on<br />
That old ship was a-slowly going down<br />
Funny way to start a picnic<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Well, I soon lost track of my kids 'n' wife<br />
So many people there I never saw in my life<br />
That old ship sinking down in the water<br />
Six thousand people trying to kill each other<br />
<br>
Dogs a-barking, cats a-meowing<br />
Women screaming, fists a-flying, babies crying<br />
<br />
Cops a-coming, me a-running<br />
Maybe we just better call off the picnic<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
I got shoved down 'n' pushed around<br />
All I could hear there was a screaming sound<br />
Don't remember one thing more<br />
Just remember walking up on a little shore<br />
Head busted, stomach cracked<br />
Feet splintered, I was bald, naked<br />
Quite lucky to be alive though<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
Feeling like I climbed out of my casket<br />
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket<br />
Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home<br />
Wishing I'd never got up that morn<br />
<br />
[Verse 8]<br />
Now, I don't care just what you do<br />
If you want a have a picnic, that's up to you<br />
But don't tell me about it, I don't want a hear it<br />
Because, see, I just lost all my picnic spirit<br />
Stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic<br />
In the bathroom<br />
<br />
[Verse 9]<br />
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny<br />
What some people are going to do for money<br />
There's a brand new gimmick every day<br />
Just to take somebody's money away<br />
I think we ought to take some of these people<br />
And put them on a boat, send them up to bear mountain<br />
For a picnic</p>
