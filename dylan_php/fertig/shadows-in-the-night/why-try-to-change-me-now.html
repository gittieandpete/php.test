I'm sentimental<br />
So I walk in the rain<br />
I've got some habits<br />
Even that I can't explain<br />
Could start for the corner<br />
Turn up in Spain<br />
Why try to change me now<br />
<br />
I sit and daydream<br />
I've got daydreams galore<br />
Cigarette ashes<br />
There they go on the floor<br />
I go away weekends<br />
And leave my keys in the door<br />
But why try to change me now<br />
<br />
<br>
Why can't I be more conventional<br />
People talk<br />
People stare<br />
So I try<br />
But that's not for me<br />
'Cause I can't see<br />
My kind of crazy world<br />
Go passing me by<br />
So let people wonder<br />
Let 'em laugh<br />
Let 'em frown<br />
You know I'll love you<br />
Till the moon's upside down<br />
<br />
Don't you remember<br />
I was always your clown<br />
Why try to change me now</p>
