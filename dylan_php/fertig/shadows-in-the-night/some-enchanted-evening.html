Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger<br />
You may see a stranger across a crowded room<br />
And somehow you know, you know even then<br />
That somehow you'll see her again and again<br />
<br />
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing<br />
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room<br />
And night after night, as strange as it seems<br />
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams<br />
<br />
<br>
Who can explain it, who can tell you why?<br />
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try<br />
<br />
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love<br />
When you feel her call you across a crowded room<br />
Then fly to her side and make her your own<br />
Or all through your life you may dream all alone<br />
<br />
Once that you found her, never let her go<br />
Once you have found her, never let her go</p>
