I'm a fool to want you<br />
I'm a fool to want you<br />
To want a love that can't be true<br />
A love that's there for others too<br />
<br />
I'm a fool to hold you<br />
Such a fool to hold you<br />
To seek a kiss not mine alone<br />
To share a kiss that Devil has known<br />
<br />
Time and time again I said I'd leave you<br />
Time and time again I went away<br />
But then would come the time when I would need you<br />
And once again these words I had to say<br />
<br>
<br />
I'm a fool to want you<br />
Pity me, I need you<br />
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong<br />
But right or wrong, I can't get along without you<br />
<br />
Time and time again I said I'd leave you<br />
Time and time again I went away<br />
But then would come the time when I would need you<br />
And once again these words I'll have to say<br />
<br />
Take me back, I love you<br />
Pity me, I need you<br />
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong<br />
But right or wrong, I can't get along without you</p>
