Where are you <br />
Where have you gone without me <br />
I thought you cared about me <br />
<br />
Where are you <br />
Where's my heart <br />
Where is the dream we started <br />
I can't believe we're parted <br />
<br />
Where are you <br />
When we said good-bye love <br />
What had we to gain <br />
When I gave you my love <br />
Was it all in vain <br />
<br />
<br>
All life through <br />
Must I go on pretending <br />
Where is my happy ending <br />
<br />
Where are you <br />
When we said good-bye love <br />
What had we to gain <br />
When I gave you my love <br />
Was it all in vain <br />
<br />
All life through <br />
Must I go on pretending <br />
Where is that happy ending <br />
Where are you <br />
Where are you</p>
