What'll I do<br />
When you are far away<br />
And I am blue<br />
What'll I do<br />
<br />
What'll I do<br />
When I am wondering who<br />
Is kissing you<br />
What'll I do<br />
<br />
What'll I do<br />
With just a photograph<br />
To tell my troubles too<br />
<br>
<br />
When I'm alone<br />
With only dreams of you<br />
That won't come true<br />
What'll I do<br />
<br />
What'll I do<br />
With just a photograph<br />
To tell my troubles too<br />
<br />
When I'm alone<br />
With only dreams of you<br />
That won't come true<br />
What'll I do</p>
