Up in the mornin', out on the job<br />
Work like the devil for my pay<br />
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do<br />
But roll around heaven all day<br />
<br />
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids<br />
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray<br />
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do<br />
But roll around heaven all day<br />
<br />
Good Lord above, can't you see I'm pining<br />
Tears in my eyes<br />
Send down that cloud with a silver lining<br />
Lift me to paradise<br />
<br>
<br />
Show me that river, take me across<br />
And wash all my troubles away<br />
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do<br />
But roll around heaven all day<br />
<br />
Oh Lord above, can't you know I'm pining<br />
Tears in my eyes<br />
Send down that cloud with a silver lining<br />
Lift me to paradise<br />
<br />
Show me that river, take me across<br />
And wash all my troubles away<br />
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do<br />
But roll around heaven all day</p>
