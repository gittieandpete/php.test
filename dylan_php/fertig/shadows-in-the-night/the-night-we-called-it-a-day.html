There was a moon out in space<br />
But a cloud drifted over it's face<br />
You kissed me and went on your way<br />
The night we called it a day<br />
<br />
I heard the song of the spheres<br />
Like a minor lament in my ears<br />
I hadn't the heart left to pray<br />
The night we called it a day<br />
<br />
Soft through the dark<br />
The hoot of an owl in the sky<br />
Sad though his song<br />
No bluer than he was I<br />
<br>
<br />
The moon went down stars were gone<br />
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn<br />
There wasn't a thing left to say<br />
The night we called it a day<br />
<br />
Soft through the dark<br />
The hoot of an owl in the sky<br />
Sad though his song<br />
No bluer than he was I<br />
<br />
The moon went down stars were gone<br />
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn<br />
There wasn't a thing left to say<br />
The night we called it a day</p>
