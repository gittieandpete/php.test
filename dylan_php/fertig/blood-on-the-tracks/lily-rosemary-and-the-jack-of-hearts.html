The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall<br />
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall<br />
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down<br />
Anyone with any sense had already left town<br />
He was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
He moved across the mirrored room "Set it up for everyone" he said<br />
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their heads<br />
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin<br />
"Could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins ?"<br />
Then he moved into the corner face down like the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
Backstage the girls were playing five card stud by the stairs<br />
Lily had two queens she was hoping for a third to match her pair<br />
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide<br />
A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside<br />
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine<br />
He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine<br />
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place<br />
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste<br />
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town<br />
She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown<br />
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear<br />
"Sorry darling, that I'm late", but he didn't seem to hear<br />
He was starring into space over at the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
"I know I've seen that face somewhere" Big Jim was thinking to himself<br />
"Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebodys shelf"<br />
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim<br />
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him<br />
Starring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
Lily was a princess she was fair-skinned and precious as a child<br />
She did whatever she had to do she had that certain flash every time she smiled<br />
She'd come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs<br />
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere<br />
But she's never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.<br />
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined<br />
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind<br />
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring<br />
<br>
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king<br />
No nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife<br />
She was tired of the attention tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife<br />
She had done a lot of bad things even once tried suicide<br />
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died<br />
She was gazing to the future riding on the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
Lily took her dress off and buried it away<br />
"Has your luck turn out" she laughed at him'. <br />
"Well I guess you must have known it would someday<br />
Be careful not to touch the wall there's a brand new coat of paint<br />
I'm glad to see you're still alive you're looking like a saint"<br />
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair<br />
"There's something funny going on" he said " I can just feel it in the air"<br />
He went to get the hanging judge but the hanging judge was drunk<br />
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk<br />
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
No one knew the circumstance, but they say it happened pretty quick<br />
The door to the dressing room burst open a cold revolver clicked<br />
And big Jim was standing there ya couldn't say surprised<br />
Rosemary right beside him steady in her eyes<br />
She was with big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall<br />
And cleaned out the bank safe it's said that they got off with quite a haul<br />
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground<br />
For one more member who had business back in town<br />
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts.<br />
<br />
The next day was hanging day the sky was overcast and black<br />
Big Jim lay covered up killed by a penknife in the back<br />
And Rosemary on the gallows she didn't even blink<br />
The hanging judge was sober he hadn't had a drink<br />
The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts.<br />
The cabaret was empty now a sign said. "Closed for repair"<br />
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair<br />
She was thinking about her father who she was rarely saw<br />
Thinking about Rosemary and thinking about the law<br />
But most of all she was thinking about the Jack of Hearts.</p>
