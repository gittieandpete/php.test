Our conversation was short and sweet<br />
It nearly swept me off my feet<br />
And I'm back in the rain, oh<br />
And you are on dry land<br />
You made it there somehow<br />
You're a big girl now<br />
<br />
meaning byMbt1967 Not much to interpret here. Songwriting doesn't get much more exposed and direct than this. Dylan magic. See all Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence<br />
He's singin' his song for me at his own expense<br />
And I'm just like that bird, oh<br />
Singin' just for you<br />
I hope that you can hear<br />
Hear me singin' through these tears<br />
<br>
<br />
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast<br />
Oh, but what a shame if all we've shared can't last<br />
I can change, I swear, oh<br />
See what you can do<br />
I can make it through<br />
You can make it too<br />
<br />
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase<br />
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days<br />
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh<br />
In somebody's room.<br />
It's a price I have to pay<br />
You're a big girl all the way</p>
