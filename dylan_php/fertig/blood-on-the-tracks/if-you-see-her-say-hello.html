If you see her, say hello,<br />
She might be in Tangiee<br />
She left here last early spring<br />
Is livin' there, I hear<br />
Say for me that I'm all right<br />
Though things get kind of slow<br />
She might think that I've forgotten her<br />
Don't tell her it isn't so<br />
<br />
We had a falling-out<br />
Like lovers often will<br />
And to think of how she left that night<br />
It still brings me a chill<br />
And though our separation<br />
It pierced me to the heart<br />
She still lives inside of me<br />
We've never been apart<br />
<br>
<br />
If you get close to her<br />
Kiss her once for me<br />
I always have respected her<br />
For doin' what she did and gettin' free<br />
Oh, whatever makes her happy<br />
I won't stand in the way<br />
Though the bitter taste still lingers on<br />
From the night I tried to make her stay<br />
<br />
I see a lot of people<br />
As I make the rounds<br />
And I hear her name here and there<br />
As I go from town to town<br />
And I've never gotten used to it<br />
I've just learned to turn it off<br />
Either I'm too sensitive<br />
Or else I'm gettin' soft</p>
