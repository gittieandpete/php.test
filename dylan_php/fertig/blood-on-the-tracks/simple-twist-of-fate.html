They sat together in the park<br />
As the evening sky grew dark<br />
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones<br />
It was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight<br />
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.<br />
<br />
They walked alone by the old canal<br />
A little confused I remember well<br />
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright<br />
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train<br />
Moving with a simple twist of fate.<br />
<br />
A saxophone someplace far off played<br />
As she was walking on by the arcade<br />
As the light bust through a-beat-up shade where he was waking up<br />
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate<br />
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.<br />
<br>
<br />
He woke up the room was bare<br />
He didn't see her anywhere<br />
He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide<br />
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate<br />
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.<br />
<br />
He hears the ticking of the clocks<br />
And walks along with a parrot that talks<br />
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in<br />
Maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait<br />
One more time for a simple twist of fate.<br />
<br />
People tell me it's a sin<br />
To know and feel too much within<br />
I still believe she was my twin but I lost the ring<br />
She was born in spring but I was born too late<br />
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.</p>
