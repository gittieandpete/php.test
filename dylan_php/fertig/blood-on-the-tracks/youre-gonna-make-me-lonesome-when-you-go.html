I've seen love go by my door<br />
It's never been this close before<br />
Never been so easy or so slow<br />
I've been shooting in the dark too long<br />
When something not right it's wrong<br />
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.<br />
<br />
Dragon clouds so high above<br />
I've only known careless love<br />
It's always hit me from below<br />
This time around it's more correct<br />
Right on target so direct<br />
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.<br />
<br />
Purple clover Queen Anne lace<br />
Crimson hair across your face<br />
You could make me cry if you don't know<br />
Can't remember what I was thinking of<br />
You might be spoiling me too much love<br />
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.<br />
<br />
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy<br />
<br>
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme<br />
Blue river running slow and lazy<br />
I could stay with you forever<br />
And never realize the time.<br />
<br />
Situations have ended sad<br />
Relationship have all been bad<br />
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud<br />
But there's no way I can compare<br />
All those scenes to this affair<br />
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.<br />
<br />
Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm doing<br />
Staying far behind without you<br />
Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm saying<br />
Yer gonna make me give myself a good talking to.<br />
<br />
I'll look for you in old Honolulu<br />
San Francisco, Ashtabula<br />
Yer gonna have to leave me now I know<br />
But I'll see you in the sky above<br />
In the tall grass in the ones I love<br />
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.</p>
