Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when<br />
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion<br />
Always on the outside of whatever side there was<br />
When they asked him why it had to be that way, well, he answered, just because<br />
<br />
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last<br />
They called Joe Crazy, the baby they called Kid Blast<br />
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too<br />
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue<br />
<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
King of the streets, child of clay<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
What made them want to come and blow you away<br />
<br />
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that<br />
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at<br />
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost got hit the roof<br />
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof<br />
<br />
Then, the war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets<br />
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats<br />
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners<br />
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs<br />
<br />
The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim<br />
Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame<br />
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, we're not those kind of men<br />
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again<br />
<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
King of the streets, child of clay<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
What made them want to come and blow you away<br />
<br />
The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith<br />
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with<br />
What time is it? said the judge to Joey when they met<br />
Five to ten, said Joey, the judge says, that's exactly what you get<br />
<br />
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich<br />
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike<br />
<br>
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand<br />
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand<br />
<br />
They let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight<br />
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great<br />
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind<br />
To the boss he said, I have returned and now I want what's mine<br />
<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
King of the streets, child of clay<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
What made them want to come and blow you away<br />
<br />
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun<br />
I'm around too many children, he'd say, they should never know of one<br />
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe<br />
Emptied out the register, said, tell 'em it was Crazy Joe<br />
<br />
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York<br />
He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork<br />
He pushed the table over to protect his family<br />
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy<br />
<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
King of the streets, child of clay<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
What made them want to come and blow you away<br />
<br />
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep<br />
I heard his best friend Frankie say, he ain't dead, he's just asleep<br />
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave<br />
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save<br />
<br />
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned<br />
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born<br />
And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve<br />
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve<br />
<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
King of the streets, child of clay<br />
Joey, Joey<br />
What made them want to come and blow you away</p>
