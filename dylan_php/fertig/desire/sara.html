I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky<br />
When the children were babies and played on the beach<br />
You came up behind me, I saw you go by<br />
You were always so close and still within reach<br />
<br />
Sara, Sara<br />
Whatever made you want to change your mind<br />
Sara, Sara<br />
So easy to look at, so hard to define<br />
<br />
I can still see them playin' with their pails in the sand<br />
They run to the water their buckets to fill<br />
I can still see the shells fallin' out of their hands<br />
As they follow each other back up the hill<br />
<br />
Sara, Sara<br />
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life<br />
Sara, Sara<br />
Radiant jewel, mystical wife<br />
<br />
Sleepin' in the woods by a fire in the night<br />
Drinkin' white rum in a Portugal bar<br />
Them playin' leapfrog and hearin' about Snow White<br />
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar<br />
<br />
Sara, Sara<br />
It's all so clear, I could never forget<br />
Sara, Sara<br />
Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret<br />
<br>
<br />
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells<br />
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through<br />
Stayin' up for days in the Chelsea Hotel<br />
Writin' sad-eyed lady of the lowlands for you<br />
<br />
Sara, Sara<br />
Wherever we travel we're never apart<br />
Sara, oh Sara<br />
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart<br />
<br />
How did I meet you? I don't know<br />
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm<br />
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow<br />
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm<br />
<br />
Sara, oh Sara<br />
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress<br />
Sara, Sara<br />
You must forgive me my unworthiness<br />
<br />
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp<br />
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore<br />
You always responded when I needed your help<br />
You gimme a map and a key to your door<br />
<br />
Sara, oh Sara<br />
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow<br />
Sara, oh Sara<br />
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go</p>
