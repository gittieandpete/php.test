I married Isis on the fifth day of May<br />
But I could not hold on to her very long<br />
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away<br />
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.<br />
<br />
I came to a high place of darkness and light<br />
The dividing line ran through the center of town<br />
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right<br />
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.<br />
<br />
A man in the corner approached me for a match<br />
I knew right away he was not ordinary<br />
He said "Are you looking for something easy to catch ?"<br />
I said "I got no money". He said "That ain't necessary".<br />
<br />
We set out that night for the cold in the North<br />
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word<br />
I said "Where are we going ?" He said "We'd be back by the fourth"<br />
I said "That's the best new that I've ever heard".<br />
<br />
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold<br />
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace<br />
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold<br />
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.<br />
<br />
How she told me that one day we meet up again<br />
And things would be different the next time we wed<br />
If I only could hang on and just be her friend<br />
I still can't remember all the best things she said.<br />
<br />
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice<br />
<br>
He said "There's a body I'm trying to find<br />
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize"<br />
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.<br />
<br />
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous<br />
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn<br />
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious<br />
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.<br />
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty<br />
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had<br />
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly<br />
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.<br />
<br />
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside<br />
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover<br />
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied<br />
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.<br />
<br />
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise<br />
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed<br />
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes<br />
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.<br />
<br />
She said "Where ya been ?" I said "No place special ?"<br />
She said "You look different" I said "Well I guess"<br />
She said "You been gone" I said "That's only natural"<br />
She said "You gonna stay ?" I said "If you want me to, Yeah ".<br />
<br />
Isis oh Isis you mystical child<br />
What drives me to you is what drives me insane<br />
I still can remember the way that you smiled<br />
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.</p>
