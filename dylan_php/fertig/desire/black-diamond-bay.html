Up on the white veranda<br />
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat<br />
Her passport shows another face<br />
From another time and place<br />
She looks nothing like that<br />
And all the remnants of her recent past<br />
Are scattered in the wild wind<br />
She walks across the marble floor<br />
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in<br />
She smiles, walks the other way<br />
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away<br />
From Black Diamond Bay.<br />
<br />
As the morning light breaks open the Greek comes down<br />
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write<br />
"Pardon monsieur" the desk clerk says<br />
Carefully removes his fez<br />
"Am I hearing you right ?"<br />
And as the yellow fog is lifting<br />
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor<br />
She passes him on the spiral staircase<br />
Thinking he's the Sovjet Ambassador<br />
She starts to speak, but he walks away<br />
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches away<br />
On Black Diamond Bay.<br />
<br />
A soldier sits beneath the fan<br />
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring<br />
Lightning strikes, the light blow out<br />
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout<br />
"Can you see anything ?"<br />
Then the Greek appears on the second floor<br />
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck<br />
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle<br />
Says "Open up another deck"<br />
But the dealer say "Attendez-vous, s'il vous pl it"<br />
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away<br />
From Black Diamond Bay.<br />
<br />
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh<br />
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough<br />
He tried to grab the woman's hand<br />
Said, "Here's a ring it cost a grand"<br />
She said, "That ain't enough"<br />
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags<br />
<br>
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb<br />
She passed the door that the Greek had locked<br />
Where a handwritten sign read, "Do not disturb"<br />
She knocked on it anyway<br />
As the sun went down and the music did play<br />
On Black Diamond Bay.<br />
<br />
"I've got to talk to someone quick !"<br />
But the Greek said, "Go away" and he kicked the chair to the floor<br />
He hung there from the chandelier<br />
She cried, "Help there's danger near<br />
Please open op the door"<br />
Then the volcano erupted<br />
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above<br />
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner<br />
Thinking of forbidden love<br />
But the desk clerk said "It happens every day"<br />
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away<br />
On Black Diamond Bay.<br />
<br />
As the island slowly sank<br />
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room<br />
The dealer said "It's too late now <br />
You can take you money, but I don't know how<br />
You'll spend it in the tomb"<br />
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear<br />
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basemen blew<br />
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tell her<br />
"My darling je vous aime beacoup"<br />
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray<br />
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away<br />
From Black Diamond Bay.<br />
<br />
I was siting home alone one night in LA<br />
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news<br />
It seems there was an earthquake that<br />
Left nothing but a Panama hat<br />
And a pair of old Greek shoes<br />
Didn't seem like much was happening<br />
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer<br />
Seems like every time you turn around<br />
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear<br />
And there's really nothing anyone can say<br />
And I never did plan to go anyway<br />
To Black Diamond Bay.</p>
