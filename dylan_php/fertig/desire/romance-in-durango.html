Hot chilli peppers in the blistering sun<br />
Dust on my face and my cape<br />
Me and Magdalena on the run<br />
I think this time we shall escape.<br />
<br />
Sold my guitar to the baker's son<br />
For a few crumbs and a place to hide<br />
But I can get another one<br />
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.<br />
<br />
No llores mi querida<br />
Dios nos vigila<br />
Soon the horse will take us to Durango<br />
Agarrame mi vida<br />
Soon the desert will be gone<br />
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.<br />
<br />
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people<br />
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone<br />
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple<br />
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina<br />
Was it my hand that held the gun ?<br />
Come let us fly my Magdalena<br />
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.<br />
<br />
No llores mi querida<br />
Dios nos vigila<br />
Soon the horse will take us to Durango<br />
Agarrame mi vida<br />
Soon the desert will be gone<br />
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.<br />
<br />
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade<br />
<br>
And watch the young torero stand alone<br />
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed<br />
When they rode with Villa into Torre6n.<br />
<br />
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old<br />
In the little church this side of town<br />
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold<br />
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.<br />
<br />
The way is long but the end is near<br />
Already the fiesta has begun<br />
The face of God will appear<br />
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.<br />
<br />
No llores mi querida<br />
Dios nos vigila<br />
Soon the horse will take us to Durango<br />
Agarrame mi vida<br />
Soon the desert will be gone<br />
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.<br />
<br />
Was that the thunder that I heard<br />
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain<br />
Come sit by me don't say a word<br />
Oh can it be that I am slain ?<br />
<br />
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun<br />
Look up in the hills that flash of light<br />
Aim well my little one<br />
We may not make it through the night.<br />
<br />
No llores mi querida<br />
Dios nos vigila<br />
Soon the horse will take us to Durango<br />
Agarrame mi vida<br />
Soon the desert will be gone<br />
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.</p>
