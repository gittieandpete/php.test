I like to spend some time in Mozambique<br />
The sunny sky is aqua blue<br />
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek<br />
It's very nice to stay a week or two<br />
And maybe fall in love just me and you<br />
<br />
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique<br />
And plenty time for good romance<br />
And everybody likes to stop and speak<br />
To give the special one you seek a chance<br />
Or maybe say hello with just a glance<br />
<br>
<br />
Lying next to her by the ocean<br />
Reaching out and touching her hand<br />
Whispering your secret emotion<br />
Magic in a magical land<br />
<br />
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique<br />
To say goodbye to sand and sea<br />
You turn around to take a final peek<br />
And you see why it's so unique to be<br />
Among the lovely people living free<br />
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique</p>
