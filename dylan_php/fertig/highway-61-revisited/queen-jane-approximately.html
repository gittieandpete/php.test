When your mother sends back all your invitations<br />
And your father to your sister he explains<br />
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
<br />
Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you<br />
And the smell of their roses does not remain<br />
And all of your children start to resent you<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
<br />
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned<br />
Have died in battle or in vain<br />
<br>
And you're sick of all this repetition<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
<br />
When all of your advisers heave their plastic<br />
At your feet to convince you of your pain<br />
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
<br />
Now when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to<br />
All lay down their bandanas and complain<br />
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?<br />
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane ?</p>
