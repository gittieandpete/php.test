I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids<br />
But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid<br />
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread<br />
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed<br />
<br />
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge<br />
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge<br />
And then she comes down a thruway, ready to sew me up with a thread<br />
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much<br />
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch<br />
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead<br />
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed, c'mon<br />
<br />
Well, you know I need a steam shovel, mama, to keep away the dead<br />
I need a dump truck, baby, to unload my head<br />
She brings me everything and more, and just like I said<br />
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed</p>
