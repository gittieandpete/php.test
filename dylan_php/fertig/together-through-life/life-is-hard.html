The evening winds are still<br />
I've lost the way and will<br />
Can't tell you where they went<br />
I just know what they meant<br />
I'm always on my guard<br />
Admitting life is hard<br />
Without you near me<br />
<br />
The friend you used to be<br />
So near and dear to me<br />
You slipped so far away<br />
Where did we go astray?<br />
I passed the old schoolyard<br />
Admitting life is hard<br />
Without you near me<br />
<br>
<br />
Ever since the day<br />
The day you went away<br />
I felt that emptiness so wide<br />
I don't know what's wrong or right<br />
I just know I need strength to fight<br />
Strength to fight that world outside<br />
<br />
Since we've been out of touch<br />
I haven't felt that much<br />
From day to barren day<br />
My heart stays locked away<br />
I walk the boulevard<br />
Admitting life is hard<br />
Without you near me</p>
