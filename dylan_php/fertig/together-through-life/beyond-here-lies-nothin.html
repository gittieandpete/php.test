Oh well, I love you pretty baby<br />
You're the only love I've ever known<br />
Just as long as you stay with me<br />
The whole world is my throne<br />
Beyond here lies nothin'<br />
Nothin' we can call our own<br />
<br />
Well, I'm movin' after midnight<br />
Down boulevards of broken cars<br />
Don't know what I'd do without it<br />
Without this love that we call ours<br />
Beyond here lies nothin'<br />
Nothin' but the moon and stars<br />
<br>
<br />
Down every street there's a window<br />
And every window's made of glass<br />
We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby<br />
For as long as love will last<br />
Beyond here lies nothin'<br />
But the mountains of the past<br />
<br />
Well, my ship is in the harbor<br />
And the sails are spread<br />
Listen to me, pretty baby<br />
Lay your hand upon my head<br />
Beyond here lies nothin'<br />
Nothin' done and nothin' said</p>
