I get the blues for you baby when I look up at the sun<br />
I get the blues for you baby when I look up at the sun<br />
Come back here, we can have some real fun<br />
<br />
Well it's early in the evening and everything is still<br />
Well it's early in the evening and everything is still<br />
One more time, I'm walking up around the hill<br />
<br />
Shake shake mama like a ship going out to sea<br />
Shake shake mama like a ship going out to sea<br />
You took all my money and you gave it to Richard Lee<br />
<br />
Down by the river judge Simpson's walking around<br />
Down by the river judge Simpson's walking around<br />
Nothing shocks me more than that old clown<br />
<br>
<br />
Some of you women, you really know your stuff<br />
Some of you women, you really know your stuff<br />
But your clothes are all torn and your language is a little too rough<br />
<br />
Shake shake mama, shake until the break of day<br />
Shake shake mama, shake until the break of day<br />
I'm right here baby, I'm not that far away<br />
<br />
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too<br />
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too<br />
It's Friday morning, going to Franklin Avenue<br />
<br />
Shake shake mama, raise your voice and bay<br />
Shake shake mama, raise your voice and bay<br />
If you're goin' on home, better go the shortest way</p>
