Last your power of recall<br />
Every little detail<br />
You don't need me to let out<br />
<br />
The times we knew<br />
Who will remember better than you<br />
Forgetful heart<br />
We have to have a good talk you and I<br />
<br />
Its been so long<br />
I will content to let the days go by<br />
But you were there<br />
You were the answer to my prayer<br />
<br>
<br />
Forgetful heart<br />
We loved with all the love that life can give<br />
But can I say without you it is so hard today<br />
Can't take much more<br />
Why can't we love like we did before<br />
<br />
Forgetful heart<br />
Like I walk in shadow in my way<br />
All night long<br />
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain<br />
The door has closed thru ever more<br />
If indeed there ever was a door</p>
