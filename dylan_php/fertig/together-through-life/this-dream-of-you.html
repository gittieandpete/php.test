How long can I stay<br />
In this nowhere cafe 'fore night turns into day<br />
I wonder why I'm so frightened of dawn<br />
All I have and all I know<br />
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on<br />
<br />
There's a moment when<br />
All old things become new again<br />
But that moment might have come and gone<br />
All I have and all I know<br />
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on<br />
<br />
I look away but I keep seeing it<br />
I don't want to believe but I keep believing it<br />
Shadows dance upon the wall<br />
Shadows that seem to know it all<br />
<br>
<br />
Am I too blind to see<br />
Is my heart playing tricks on me<br />
I'm lost in the crowd, all my tears are gone<br />
All I have and all I know<br />
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on<br />
<br />
Everything I touch seems to disappear<br />
Everywhere I turn, you are always here<br />
I'll run this race until my earthly death<br />
I'll defend this place with my dying breath<br />
<br />
From a cheerless room<br />
In a curtain gloom, I saw a star from Heaven fall<br />
I turned and looked again but it was gone<br />
All I have and all I know<br />
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on</p>
