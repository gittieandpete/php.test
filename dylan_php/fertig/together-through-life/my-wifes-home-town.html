Well I didn't come here to deal with a doggone thing<br />
I just came here to hear the drop of cymbaline<br />
There ain't no way you can put me down<br />
I just wanna say that hell's my wife's home town<br />
<br />
Well there's reasons for that, and reasons for this<br />
I can't think of any just now, but I know they exist<br />
I'm sittin in the sun 'till my skin turns brown<br />
I just wanna say that hell's my wife's home town<br />
Home town, home town<br />
<br />
She can make you steal, make you rob<br />
Give you the hives, make you lose your job<br />
Make things bad, she can make things worse<br />
She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse<br />
<br>
<br />
One of these days I'll end up on the run<br />
I'm pretty sure she'll make me kill someone<br />
I'm going inside, roll the shutters down<br />
I just wanna say that hell's my wife's home town<br />
<br />
Well there's plenty to remember, plenty to forget<br />
I still can remember the day we met<br />
I lost my reasons a long ago<br />
My love for her is all I know<br />
<br />
State gone broke, the county's dry<br />
Don't be lookin' at me with that evil eye<br />
Keep on walking, don't be hanging around<br />
I'm tellin you again that hell's my wife's home town<br />
Home town, home town</p>
