Well I'm lookin the world over<br />
Looking far off into the east<br />
And i see my baby comin'<br />
She's walking with the village beast<br />
I feel a change comin' on<br />
And the last part of the day's already gone<br />
<br />
We got so much in common<br />
We strive for the same old ends<br />
And I just can't wait<br />
Wait for us to become friends<br />
I feel a change comin' on<br />
And the fourth part of the day's already gone<br />
<br />
Well life is for love<br />
And they say that love is blind<br />
If you wanna live easy<br />
Baby, pack your clothes with mine<br />
I feel a change comin' on<br />
And the fourth part of the day's already gone<br />
<br />
Well now what's the use in dreaming<br />
<br>
You got better things to do<br />
Dreams never did work for me anyway<br />
Even when they did come true<br />
<br />
You are as porous as ever<br />
Baby you can start a fire<br />
I must be losing my mind<br />
You're the object of my desire<br />
I feel a change comin' on<br />
And the fourth part of the day's already gone<br />
<br />
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver<br />
And i'm reading James Joyce<br />
Some people they tell me<br />
I got the blood of the land in my voice<br />
<br />
Everybody got all the money<br />
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes<br />
Everybody got all the flowers<br />
I don't have one single rose<br />
I feel a change comin' on<br />
And the fourth part of the day's already gone</p>
