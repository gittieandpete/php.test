If you ever go to Houston better walk right<br />
Keep your hands in your pockets and your gun-belts tied<br />
If you're asking for drama, if you're looking for a fight<br />
If you ever go to Houston, boy you better walk right<br />
<br />
If you're ever down there on Bagby and Lamar<br />
You better watch out for the man with the shining star<br />
Better know where you're going or stay where you are<br />
If you're ever down there on Bagby and Lamar<br />
<br />
Well I know these streets I've been here before<br />
I nearly got killed here during the Mexican War<br />
Something always keeps me coming back for more<br />
I know these streets I've been here before<br />
<br />
If you ever go to Dallas, say hello to Mary-Ann<br />
Say I'm still looking along the trigger, hanging on the best I can<br />
<br>
If you see her sister Lucy, say I'm sorry I'm not there<br />
Tell her other sister Nancy to pray the sinner's prayer<br />
<br />
I gotta rest this fever bury it in my brain<br />
Better keep right forward, can't spoil the game<br />
The same way I'll leave here will be the way that I came<br />
Gotta rest this fever bury it in my brain<br />
<br />
Mr. policeman, can you help me find my gal<br />
Last time I saw her was at the Magnolia Motel<br />
If you help me find her, you can be my pal<br />
Mr. policeman, can you help me find my gal<br />
<br />
If you ever go to Austin, Fort Worth or San Anton'<br />
Find the barrooms I got lost in and send my memories home<br />
Put my tears in a bottle screw the top on tight<br />
If you ever go to Houston, buddy you'd better walk right</p>
