Well you're coming down High Street walking in the sun<br />
You make a dead man rise and holler she's the one<br />
Jolene, Jolene<br />
Baby I am the king and you're the queen<br />
<br />
Well it's a long old highway that don't ever end<br />
I got a Saturday Night Special, I'm back again<br />
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line<br />
You probably don't know but I'm gonna make you mine<br />
<br />
Jolene, Jolene<br />
Baby I am the king and you is the queen<br />
<br />
I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm movin' along<br />
<br>
People think they know, but they're all wrong<br />
You're something nice, I'm gonna bet my dice<br />
I can't say I haven't paid the price<br />
<br />
Jolene, Jolene<br />
Baby I am the king and you is the queen<br />
<br />
Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill<br />
You can't fight somebody with his back to a hill<br />
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark<br />
If you hold me in your arms, things don't look so dark<br />
<br />
Jolene, Jolene<br />
Baby I am the king and you're the queen</p>
