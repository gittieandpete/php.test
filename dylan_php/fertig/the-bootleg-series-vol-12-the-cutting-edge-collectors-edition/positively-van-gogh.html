[Verse 1]<br />
When I'd ask why the painting was deadly<br />
Nobody could pick up my sign<br />
'Cept for the cook, she was always friendly<br />
But she'd only ask, "What's on your mind?"<br />
She'd say that especially when it was raining<br />
I'd say "Oh, I don't know"<br />
But then she'd press and I'd say, "You see that painting?<br />
Do you think it's been done by Van Gogh?"<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
The cook she said call her Maria<br />
She'd always point for the same boy to come forth<br />
Saying, "He trades cattle, it's his own idea<br />
And he also makes trips to the North<br />
Have you ever seen his naked calf bleed?"<br />
I'd say, "Oh no, why does it show?"<br />
And she'd whisper in my ear that he's a half-breed<br />
And I'd say, "Fine, but can he paint like Van Gogh?"<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
I can't remember his name he never gave it<br />
But I always figured he could go home<br />
Til when he'd gave me his card and said, "Save it"<br />
I could see by his eyes he was alone<br />
But it was sad how his four leaf clover<br />
Drawn on his calling card showed<br />
<br>
That it was given back to him a-many times over<br />
And it most definitely was not done by Van Gogh<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
It was either she or the maid just to please me<br />
Though I sensed she could not understand<br />
And she made a thing out of it by saying, "Go easy<br />
He's a straight, but he's a very crooked straight man."<br />
And I'd say, "Does the girl in the calendar doubt it?<br />
And by the way is it Marilyn Monroe?"<br />
But she'd just speak softly and say, "Why you wanna know about it?"<br />
And I'd say, "I was just wondering if she ever sat for Van Gogh."<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
It was either her or the straight man who introduced me<br />
To Jeanette, Camilla's friend<br />
Who later on falsely accused me of stealing her locket and pen<br />
When I said "I don't have the locket"<br />
She said "You steal pictures of everybody's mother I know"<br />
And I said "There's no locket<br />
No picture of any mother I would pocket<br />
Unless it's been done by Van Gogh."<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
Camilla's house stood on the outskirts<br />
How strange to see the chandeliers destroyed<br />
While [?] beneath the velvet carpet<br />
Of fox hunts and love far before</p>
