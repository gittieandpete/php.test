Ollie told me i'm a fool. so i<br />
Walked on down the road a mile, went to the house that brings a smile<br />
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, and what do you think he said to me?<br />
<br />
(chorus:)<br />
When you awake you will remember ev'rything, you will be<br />
Hangin' on a string from your... when you believe, you will relieve the only<br />
Soul<br />
That you were born with to grow old and never know<br />
<br />
Ollie showed me the fork in the road.<br />
You can take to the left or go straight to the right,<br />
Use your days and save your nights,<br />
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,<br />
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.<br />
<br />
(repeat chorus)<br />
<br />
<br>
Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,<br />
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;<br />
But what am i supposed to do:<br />
Read the writing on the wall,<br />
I heard itwhen i was very small.<br />
<br />
(repeat chorus)<br />
<br />
Wash my hand in lye water, i got a date with the<br />
Captains daughter. you can go and tell your brother. we sure gonna<br />
Love one another, oh! you<br />
May be right and ya might be wrong, i ain't gonna worry all day long.<br />
<br />
Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, my old car froze<br />
Up last night. ain't no reason to hang your head i could wake up in the<br />
Mornin' dead. oh! and<br />
If i thought it would do any good, i'd stand on the rock where moses stood.<br />
