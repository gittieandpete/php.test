Oh god said to abraham, &quot;kill me a son&quot;<br />
Abe says, &quot;man, you must be puttin' me on&quot;<br />
God say, &quot;no.&quot; abe say, &quot;what?&quot;<br />
God say, &quot;you can do what you want abe, but<br />
The next time you see me comin' you better run&quot;<br />
Well abe says, &quot;where do you want this killin' done?&quot;<br />
God says, &quot;out on highway 61.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well georgia sam he had a bloody nose<br />
Welfare department they wouldn't give him no clothes<br />
He asked poor howard where can i go<br />
Howard said there's only one place i know<br />
Sam said tell me quick man i got to run<br />
0l' howard just pointed with his gun<br />
And said that way down on highway 61.<br />
<br />
Well mack the finger said to louie the king<br />
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings<br />
And a thousand telephones that don't ring<br />
Do you know where i can get rid of these things<br />
<br>
And louie the king said let me think for a minute son<br />
And he said yes i think it can be easily done<br />
Just take everything down to highway 61.<br />
<br />
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night<br />
Told the first father that things weren't right<br />
My complexion she said is much too white<br />
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right<br />
Let me tell the second mother this has been done<br />
But the second mother was with the seventh son<br />
And they were both out on highway 61.<br />
<br />
Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored<br />
He was tryin' to create a next world war<br />
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor<br />
He said i never engaged in this kind of thing before<br />
But yes i think it can be very easily done<br />
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun<br />
And have it on highway 61.<br />
