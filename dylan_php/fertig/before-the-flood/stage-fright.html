Now deep in the heart of a lonely kid<br />
Who suffered so much for what he did,<br />
They gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame,<br />
Since that day he ain't been the same.<br />
<br />
See the man with the stage fright<br />
Just standin' up there to give it all his might.<br />
And he got caught in the spotlight,<br />
But when we get to the end<br />
He wants to start all over again.<br />
<br />
I've got fire water right on my breath<br />
And the doctor warned me i might catch a death.<br />
Said, &quot;you can make it in your disguise,<br />
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
See the man with the stage fright,<br />
Just standin' up there to give it all his might.<br />
He got caught in the spotlight,<br />
But when we get to the end<br />
He wants to start all over again.<br />
<br>
<br />
Now if he says that he's afraid,<br />
Take him at his word.<br />
And for the price that the poor boy has paid,<br />
He gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh.<br />
<br />
Your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry,<br />
Fancy people go driftin' by.<br />
The moment of truth is right at hand,<br />
Just one more nightmare you can stand.<br />
<br />
See the man with the stage fright<br />
Just standin' up there to give it all his might.<br />
And he got caught in the spotlight,<br />
But when we get to the end<br />
He wants to start all over again, hmm hmm,<br />
<br />
You wanna try it once again, hmm hmm,<br />
Please don't make him stop, hmm hmm,<br />
Let him take it from the top, hmm hmm,<br />
Let him start all over again.<br />
