Virgil caine is the name,<br />
And i served on the danville train,<br />
'til stoneman's cavalry<br />
Came and tore up the tracks again.<br />
In the winter of '65,<br />
We were hungry, just barely alive.<br />
By may the tenth, richmond had fell,<br />
It's a time i remember, oh so well,<br />
<br />
The night they drove old dixie down,<br />
And the bells were ringing,<br />
The night they drove old dixie down,<br />
And the people were singin'.<br />
<br />
They went<br />
La, la, la, la, la, la,<br />
La, la, la, la, la, la,<br />
La, la,<br />
<br />
Back with my wife in tennessee,<br />
When one day she called to me,<br />
<br>
&quot;virgil, quick, come see,<br />
There goes robert e. lee!&quot;<br />
Now i don't mind choppin' wood,<br />
And i don't care if the money's no good.<br />
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest,<br />
But they should never have taken the very best.<br />
<br />
The night they drove old dixie down,<br />
And the bells were ringing,<br />
The night they drove old dixie down,<br />
And the people were singin'.<br />
<br />
Like my father before me,<br />
I will work the land,<br />
Like my brother above me,<br />
Who took a rebel stand.<br />
He was just eighteen, proud and brave,<br />
But a yankee laid him in his grave,<br />
I swear by the mud below my feet,<br />
You can't raise a caine back up<br />
When he's in defeat.<br />
