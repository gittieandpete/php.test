J. r. robertson<br />
<br />
Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket,<br />
Never let it slip away.<br />
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray.<br />
When ya get half cra-zy from the august heat<br />
Or on a frozen, rotted road<br />
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet.<br />
<br />
Chorus:<br />
You're gonna walk that endless highway,<br />
Walk that high-way till you die.<br />
All you children goin' my way,<br />
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye.<br />
<br />
When i see a detour up ahead,<br />
<br>
Well, i leave it far behind,<br />
Who knows what you're apt to find there.<br />
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',<br />
Well it look like t'me this time i wont be buyin'<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
When they get a scapegoat by the throat,<br />
It's hard labour and cold beans.<br />
If ya get away real quick,<br />
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine.<br />
Well, i sing by night, wander by day.<br />
I'm on the road and it looks like i'm here to stay.<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
