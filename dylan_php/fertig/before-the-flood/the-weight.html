I pulled into nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead;<br />
I just need some place where i can lay my head.<br />
&quot;hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?&quot;<br />
He just grinned and shook my hand, and &quot;no!&quot;, was all he said.<br />
<br />
(chorus:)<br />
Take a load off fanny, take a load for free;<br />
Take a load off fanny, and (and) (and) you can put the load right on me.<br />
<br />
I picked up my bag, i went lookin' for a place to hide;<br />
When i saw carmen and the devil walkin' side by side.<br />
I said, &quot;hey, carmen, come on, let's go downtown.&quot;<br />
She said, &quot;i gotta go, but m'friend can stick around.&quot;<br />
<br />
(chorus)<br />
<br />
Go down, miss moses, there's nothin' you can say<br />
It's just ol' luke, and luke's waitin' on the judgement day.<br />
<br>
&quot;well, luke, my friend, what about young anna lee?&quot;<br />
He said, &quot;do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep anna lee company?&quot;<br />
<br />
(chorus)<br />
<br />
Crazy chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog.<br />
He said, &quot;i will fix your rack, if you'll take jack, my dog.&quot;<br />
I said, &quot;wait a minute, chester, you know i'm a peaceful man.&quot;<br />
He said, &quot;that's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
(chorus)<br />
<br />
Catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line<br />
My bag is sinkin' low and i do believe it's time.<br />
To get back to miss fanny, you know she's the only one.<br />
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone.<br />
<br />
(chorus)<br />
