up on cripple creek<br />
<br />
<br />
When i get off of this mountain<br />
<br />
You know where i want to go<br />
<br />
Straight down the mississippi river<br />
<br />
To the gulf of mexico<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To lake charles, louisiana<br />
<br />
Little bessie, a girl that i once knew<br />
<br />
And she told me just to come on by<br />
<br />
If there's anything she could do<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
{refrain}<br />
<br />
Up on cripple creek she sends me<br />
<br />
If i spring a leak she mends me<br />
<br />
I don't have to speak she defends me<br />
<br />
A drunkard's dream if i ever did see one<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck had just stung me<br />
<br />
To the race track i did go<br />
<br />
She bet on one horse to win<br />
<br />
And i bet on another to show<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Odds were in my favor<br />
<br />
I had him five to one<br />
<br />
When that nag to win came around the track<br />
<br />
Sure enough he had won<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
{refrain}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I took up all of my winnings<br />
<br />
And i gave my little bessie half<br />
<br />
And she tore it up and blew it in my face<br />
<br>
<br />
Just for a laugh<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world<br />
<br />
I sure would like to see<br />
<br />
That's when that little love of mine<br />
<br />
Dips her doughnut in my tea<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
{refrain}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now me and my mate were back at the shack<br />
<br />
We had spike jones on the box<br />
<br />
She said, &quot;i can't take the way he sings<br />
<br />
But i love to hear him talk&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that just gave my heart a fall<br />
<br />
To the bottom of my feet<br />
<br />
And i swore as i took another pull<br />
<br />
My bessie can't be beat<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
{refrain}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, it's hot in california<br />
<br />
And up north it's freezing cold<br />
<br />
And this living off the road<br />
<br />
Is getting pretty old<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So i guess i'll call up my big mama<br />
<br />
Tell her i'll be rolling in<br />
<br />
Bet you know, deep down, i'm kinda tempted<br />
<br />
To go and see my bessie again<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
{refrain}<br />
