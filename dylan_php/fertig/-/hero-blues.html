[Verse 1]<br />
Yes, the gal I got<br />
I swear she's the screaming end<br />
She wants me to be a hero<br />
So she can tell all her friends<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Well, she begged, she cried<br />
She pleaded with me all last night<br />
Well, she begged, she cried<br />
She pleaded with me all last night<br />
She wants me to go out<br />
And find somebody to fight<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
She reads too many books<br />
She got new movies inside her head<br />
She reads too many books<br />
<br>
She got movies inside her head<br />
She wants me to walk out running<br />
She wants me to crawl back dead<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
You need a different kinda man, babe<br />
One that can grab and hold your heart<br />
Need a different kind of man, babe<br />
One that can hold and grab your heart<br />
You need a different kind of man, babe<br />
You need Napoleon Boneeparte<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Well, when I'm dead<br />
No more good times will I crave<br />
When I'm dead<br />
No more good times will I crave<br />
You can stand and shout hero<br />
All over my lonesome grave</p>
