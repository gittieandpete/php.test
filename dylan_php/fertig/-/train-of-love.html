Train of love's a comin', big black wheels are hummin'<br />
People waitin' at the station, happy hearts are drummin'<br />
Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby<br />
<br />
Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam<br />
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home<br />
<br />
Now stop your whistle blowin' 'cause I've got ways of knowin'<br />
You're bringin' other people's lovers but my own keeps goin'<br />
Train of love deceivin', when she's not gone she's leavin'<br />
<br />
Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam<br />
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home<br />
<br>
<br />
Train of love now hasten, sweethearts stand and waitin'<br />
Here and there and everywhere there'll gonna be embracin'<br />
Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby<br />
<br />
Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam<br />
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home<br />
<br />
Train of love's a leavin', leavin' my heart grievin'<br />
But early or late I sit and wait because I'm still believin'<br />
We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever<br />
<br />
Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam<br />
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home</p>
