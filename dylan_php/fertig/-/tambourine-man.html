I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand<br />
Left me blindly here to stand<br />
And but for the sky<br />
There are no fences facin'<br />
<br />
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet<br />
I have no one to meet<br />
But the ancient empty street's<br />
Too dead for dreaming<br />
<br />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you<br />
<br />
And take me for a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship<br />
All my senses have been stripped<br />
And my hands can't feel to grip<br />
And my toes too numb to step<br />
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'<br />
<br />
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade<br />
Into my own parade<br />
Cast your dancing spell my way<br />
I promise to go under it<br />
<br>
<br />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you<br />
<br />
Take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind<br />
Down the foggy ruins of time<br />
Far past the frozen leaves<br />
Of the haunted, frightened trees<br />
Out to the windy beach<br />
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow<br />
<br />
I want to dance beneath the diamond sky<br />
With one hand waving free<br />
Silhouetted by the sea<br />
Circled by the circus sands<br />
With all memory and fate<br />
Driven deep beneath the waves<br />
Let me forget about today until tomorrow<br />
<br />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you</p>
