Well, I'm pressing on<br />
Yes, I'm pressing on<br />
Well, I'm pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my Lord<br />
Well, I'm pressing on<br />
Pressing on<br />
Well, I'm pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my Lord<br />
Pressing on<br />
Pressing on<br />
I know I'm pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my Lord<br />
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind<br />
Say, "Prove to me that He is Lord, show me a sign"<br />
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within<br />
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?<br />
I just keep pressing on<br />
On and on and on and on<br />
Pressing on<br />
Well, I'm pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my Lord<br />
Pressing on<br />
On and on and on and on<br />
Pressing on<br />
Well, I keep turning 'round<br />
Pressing on<br />
<br>
To the higher calling of my Lord<br />
Oh Lord, yeah<br />
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back<br />
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack<br />
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the Devil reign<br />
Because he sinned I got no choice, it run's in my vein<br />
Well, I'm pressing on<br />
On and on and on and on<br />
Pressing on, oh yes, I am<br />
Pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my Lord<br />
Well, I'm pressing on<br />
On and on and on and on<br />
I'm pressing on<br />
Pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my Lord<br />
Pressing on<br />
On and on and on and on<br />
Pressing on<br />
Pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my Lord<br />
Pressing on<br />
On and on and on and on<br />
Pressing on<br />
Pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my Lord</p>
