Tweeter and the Monkey Man were hard up for cash<br />
They stayed up all night selling cocaine and hash<br />
To an undercover cop who had a sister named Jan<br />
For reasons unexplained she loved the Monkey Man<br />
<br />
Tweeter was a boy scout before she went to Vietnam<br />
And found out the hard way nobody gives a damn<br />
They knew that they found freedom just across the Jersey Line<br />
So they hopped into a stolen car, took Highway 99<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
And the walls came down, all the way to hell<br />
Never saw them when they're standing, never saw them when they fell<br />
<br />
The undercover cop never liked the Monkey Man<br />
Even back in childhood he wanted to see him in the can<br />
Jan got married at fourteen to a racketeer named Bill<br />
She made secret calls to the Monkey Man from a mansion on the hill<br />
<br />
It was out on Thunder Road, Tweeter at the wheel<br />
They crashed into paradise, they could hear them tires squeal<br />
The undercover cop pulled up and said "Everyone of you's a liar<br />
If you don't surrender now, it's gonna go down to the wire"<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
An ambulance rolled up, a state trooper close behind<br />
Tweeter took his gun away and messed up his mind<br />
The undercover cop was left tied up to a tree<br />
Near the souvenir stand by the old abandoned factory<br />
<br>
<br />
Next day the undercover cop was hot in pursuit<br />
He was taking the whole thing personal, he didn't care about the loot<br />
Jan had told him many times it was you to me who taught<br />
In Jersey anything's legal as long as you don't get caught<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
Someplace by Rahway Prison they ran out of gas<br />
The undercover cop had cornered them said "Boy, you didn't think that this could last"<br />
Jan jumped out of the bed, said "There's someplace I gotta go"<br />
She took a gun out of the drawer and said "It's best if you don't know"<br />
<br />
The undercover cop was found face down in a field<br />
The monkey man was on the river bridge using Tweeter as a shield<br />
Jan said to the Monkey Man, "I'm not fooled by Tweeter's curl<br />
I knew him long before he ever became a Jersey girl"<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
Now the town of Jersey City is quieting down again<br />
I'm sitting in a gambling club called A Lion's Den<br />
The TV set been blown up, every bit of it is gone<br />
Ever since the nightly news show that the Monkey Man was on<br />
<br />
I guess I'll go to Florida and get myself some sun<br />
There ain't no more opportunity here, everything's been done<br />
Sometimes I think of Tweeter, sometime I think of Jan<br />
Sometimes I don't think about nothing but the Monkey Man<br />
<br />
[Chorus]</p>
