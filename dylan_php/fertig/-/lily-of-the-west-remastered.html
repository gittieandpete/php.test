When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find<br />
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind<br />
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast<br />
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West<br />
<br />
(And the name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West)<br />
<br />
I courted lovely Flora, some pleasure for to find<br />
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind<br />
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me off my rest<br />
Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West<br />
<br />
(Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West)<br />
<br />
'Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree<br />
Conversing with my Flora there, which seemed so strange to me<br />
And the answer that she gave to him, it sore did me oppress<br />
<br>
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West<br />
<br />
(I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West)<br />
<br />
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand<br />
I seized him by the collar, and boldly made him stand<br />
Being mad by desperation, I pierced him through the breast<br />
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West<br />
<br />
(All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West)<br />
<br />
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea;<br />
They placed me in the witness box, and then commenced on me<br />
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest<br />
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West<br />
<br />
(Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West)</p>
