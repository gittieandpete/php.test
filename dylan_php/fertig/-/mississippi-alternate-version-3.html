I'm standing in the shadows with an aching heart<br />
I'm looking at the world tear itself apart<br />
And it's turned to hours, hours turned to days<br />
I'm still loving you in a million ways<br />
Well the devil's in the alley, there's a mule kicking in my stall<br />
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all<br />
I was raised in the country, I've been working in town<br />
I've been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down<br />
Well I ain't got nothing for you, I had nothing before<br />
Don't even have anything for myself anymore<br />
The sky is full of fire, pain is pouring down<br />
There's nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around<br />
Well I got here following the Southern star<br />
I crossed that river just to be where you are<br />
There's only one thing I did wrong<br />
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long<br />
Well I've been loving you too long, I know you ain't no good<br />
Don't make a bit of difference to me, don't see why it should<br />
I was thinking about the things that Rosie said<br />
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed<br />
Well I'm walking through the leaves falling from the trees<br />
I feel like a stranger nobody sees<br />
So many things we never will undo<br />
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too<br />
<br>
Some people will offer their hand and some won't<br />
Last night I knew ya, tonight I don't<br />
I need something strong to distract my mind<br />
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind<br />
Well everybody's moving, God knows where<br />
But I'm still here, you're still there<br />
Only one thing I did wrong<br />
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long<br />
Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast<br />
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past<br />
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free<br />
I got nothing but affection for those who have sailed with me<br />
Winter goes into the summer, summer goes into fall<br />
I look into the mirror, don't see anything at all<br />
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow<br />
Things should start to get interesting right about now<br />
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin<br />
And as tight as the corner that I've painted myself in<br />
I know good fortune is waiting to be kind<br />
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine<br />
The emptiness is endless, cold as the clay<br />
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way<br />
Only one thing that I did wrong<br />
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long</p>
