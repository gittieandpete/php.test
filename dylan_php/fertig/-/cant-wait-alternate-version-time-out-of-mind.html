I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind<br />
I can't wait, waitin' just makin' me go blind<br />
Do you ever lay awake at night your face turned to the wall<br />
Drownin' in your thoughtlessness and cut off from it all<br />
I don't know, maybe to you it's not that late<br />
But as for me don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
<br />
It's got to end, everything about it just feels wrong<br />
I pretend, being close to her is where I don't belong<br />
Well my back is to the sun because the light is too intense<br />
I can see what everybody in the world is up against<br />
I'll stay here where I can feel the hand of fate<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
<br />
Skies are grey, life is short and I think of her a lot<br />
I can't say if I want the pain to end or not<br />
<br>
Well the blindness overtakin' me is beatin' like a drum<br />
I don't know where it starts or where it's coming from<br />
How it is, we'll all try to concentrate<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
<br />
I been drinkin'<br />
Drinkin' forbidden juices<br />
I been livin'<br />
Livin' on lame excuses<br />
<br />
My hands are cold, the end of time has just begun<br />
I'm getting old, anything can happen now to anyone<br />
I walk across the floor 'til I wear out my shoes<br />
You think you've lost it all there's always more to lose<br />
I'm so clear, she can keep my head on straight<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait</p>
