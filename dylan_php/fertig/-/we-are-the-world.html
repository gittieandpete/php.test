There comes a time when we heed a certain call<br />
When the world must come together as one<br />
There are people dying<br />
And it's time to lend a hand to life<br />
The greatest gift of all<br />
<br />
We can't go on pretending day by day<br />
That someone, somehow will soon make a change<br />
We are all a part of God's great big family<br />
And the truth, you know<br />
Love is all we need<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
We are the world, we are the children<br />
We are the ones who make a brighter day<br />
So lets start giving<br />
There's a choice we're making<br />
<br>
We're saving our own lives<br />
It's true we'll make a better day<br />
Just you and me<br />
<br />
Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares<br />
And their lives will be stronger and free<br />
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread<br />
So we all must lend a helping hand<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all<br />
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall<br />
Let us realize that a change can only come<br />
When we stand together as one<br />
<br />
[Chorus: x2]<br />
Thank you</p>
