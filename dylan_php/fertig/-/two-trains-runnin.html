Well there's two trains running<br />
And they're running this way<br />
One leaves at midnight<br />
The other at the break of day<br />
At the break of day<br />
At the break of day<br />
Oh Lordy<br />
<br />
I've been troubled, I've been a fool<br />
I've been crazy my whole life<br />
Well, I done fell in love<br />
With another man's wife<br />
With another man's wife<br />
Oh, Lordy<br />
<br />
I'm gonna find me a woman<br />
Who shines like a morning star<br />
I'm gonna find me a woman<br />
Ride like a Cadillac car<br />
Ride like a Cadillac car<br />
<br>
Ride like a Cadillac car<br />
Oh, lordy<br />
Oh, lordy<br />
<br />
Well I'm afraid of everybody<br />
And I can't trust myself<br />
Well, the woman I love has<br />
Put me on top of the shelf<br />
Put me on top of the shelf<br />
Put me on top of the shelf<br />
Oh, Lordy<br />
Oh, Lordy<br />
<br />
Well ther's two trains running<br />
And they're running this way<br />
One leaves at midnight<br />
Other at the break of day<br />
At the break of day<br />
At the break of day<br />
At the break of day</p>
