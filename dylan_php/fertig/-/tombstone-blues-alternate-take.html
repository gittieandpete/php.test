The sweet pretty things are in bed now, of course<br />
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse<br />
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse<br />
But the town has no need to be nervous<br />
<br />
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits<br />
To Jezebel the nun, she violently knits<br />
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits<br />
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce<br />
<br />
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes<br />
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food<br />
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues<br />
<br />
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade<br />
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made"<br />
Then sends for the doctor who pulls down the shade<br />
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in"<br />
<br />
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside<br />
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride<br />
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride<br />
You will not die, it's not poison"<br />
<br />
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes<br />
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food<br />
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues<br />
<br />
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief<br />
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief<br />
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief<br />
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"<br />
<br />
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly<br />
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"<br />
And dropping a barbell, he points to the sky<br />
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken"<br />
<br />
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes<br />
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food<br />
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues<br />
<br>
<br />
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save<br />
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves<br />
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves<br />
Then sends them out to the jungle<br />
<br />
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps<br />
With his faithful slave Pedro, behind him he tramps<br />
With a fantastic collection of stamps<br />
To win friends and influence his uncle<br />
<br />
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes<br />
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food<br />
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues<br />
<br />
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone<br />
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown<br />
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone<br />
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter<br />
<br />
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill<br />
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill<br />
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille<br />
He could die happily ever after<br />
<br />
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes<br />
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food<br />
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues<br />
<br />
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped a bed roll<br />
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole<br />
And the National Bank, at a profit, sells road maps for the soul<br />
To the old folks home and the college<br />
<br />
I wish I could write you a melody so plain<br />
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane<br />
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain<br />
Of your useless and pointless knowledge<br />
<br />
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes<br />
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food<br />
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues</p>
