All over town<br />
That you've been seen, a-runnin' 'round<br />
I know that I should leave but then<br />
I just can't go, you win again<br />
<br />
This heart of mine could never see<br />
What everybody knew but me<br />
Just trustin' you was my great sin<br />
What can I do, you win again<br />
<br>
<br />
I'm sorry for your victim now<br />
Ah, soon his head like mine will bow<br />
Yes, he give his heart but all in vain<br />
As some they say, you win again<br />
<br />
You have no heart, you have no shame<br />
You take too long and give the blame<br />
I guess I should not complain<br />
I love you still, you win again</p>
