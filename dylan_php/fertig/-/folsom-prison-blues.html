I hear that train a-rolling, it's a-rolling round the bend<br />
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when<br />
I'm stucked in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on<br />
And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone<br />
<br />
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son<br />
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns<br />
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die<br />
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry<br />
<br>
<br />
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars<br />
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars<br />
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free<br />
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me<br />
<br />
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine<br />
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line<br />
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay<br />
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away</p>
