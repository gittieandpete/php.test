Well, a young marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred the man<br />
Put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together<br />
Come on, come on stick together<br />
You know, you made a vow, not to leave one another, never<br />
Well, ya never miss your water till your well runs dry<br />
Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together<br />
Come on, come on, stick together<br />
We made a vow, not to leave one another, never<br />
<br>
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry<br />
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together<br />
Come on, come on, lets stick together<br />
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never<br />
It might be tough for a while but consider the child<br />
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together<br />
Come on, come on, stick together<br />
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never</p>
