There must be some way out of here<br />
Said the joker to the thief<br />
There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief<br />
Businessmen, they drink my wine<br />
Plowmen dig my earth<br />
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth<br />
No reason to get excited,the thief, he kindly spoke<br />
<br>
There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke<br />
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate<br />
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late<br />
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view<br />
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too<br />
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl<br />
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl</p>
