Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carrol<br />
THE LONESOME DEATH OF HATTIE CARROLL<br />
Bob Dylan<br />
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll<br />
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger<br />
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'<br />
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him<br />
As they rode him in custody down to the station<br />
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder<br />
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for<br />
Your tears<br />
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years<br />
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres<br />
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him<br />
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland<br />
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders<br />
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was<br />
Snarling<br />
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking<br />
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for<br />
Your tears<br />
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen<br />
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children<br />
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage<br />
And never sat once at the head of the table<br />
And didn't even talk to the people at the table<br />
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table<br />
<br>
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level<br />
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane<br />
That sailed through the air and came down through the room<br />
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle<br />
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger<br />
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for<br />
Your tears<br />
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel<br />
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the<br />
Level<br />
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and<br />
Persuaded<br />
And that even the nobles get properly handled<br />
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em<br />
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom<br />
Stared at the person who killed for no reason<br />
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'<br />
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished<br />
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance<br />
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence<br />
Oh, but you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all<br />
Fears<br />
Bury the rag deep in your face, for now's the time for your<br />
Tears<br />
