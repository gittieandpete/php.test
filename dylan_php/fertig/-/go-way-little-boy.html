Go 'way little boy<br />
I'm not for you<br />
Go back to her<br />
Where you'll be more secure<br />
She knows you better than I do<br />
Go 'way little boy<br />
I'm not for you<br />
Go 'way little boy<br />
You're making me sad<br />
I don't wanna to see you bleed<br />
She's the one that you need<br />
You'll never miss what you ain't never had<br />
Go 'way little boy<br />
You're making me sad<br />
Go 'way little boy<br />
It's much too late<br />
<br>
Walk back out the door<br />
Don't wanna see you here no more<br />
You're making it hard for me to concentrate<br />
Go 'way little boy<br />
It's much too late<br />
Can't you hear your mama callin'<br />
Don't you recognize her voice<br />
I think you'd better heed her warning<br />
While you still have the choice<br />
Go 'way little boy<br />
You're much too late<br />
Your future's lookin' bright<br />
Don't throw it away tonight<br />
It's getting hard for me to look you in the eye<br />
Go 'way little boy<br />
Can't you see that you're makin' me cry</p>
