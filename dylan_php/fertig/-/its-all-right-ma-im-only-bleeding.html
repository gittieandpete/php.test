Darkness at the break of noon<br />
Shadows even the silver spoon<br />
The handmade blade, the child's balloon<br />
Eclipses both the sun and moon<br />
To understand you know too soon<br />
There is no sense in trying.<br />
<br />
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn<br />
Suicide remarks are torn<br />
From the fool's gold mouthpiece<br />
The hollow horn plays wasted words<br />
Proves to warn<br />
That he not busy being born<br />
Is busy dying.<br />
<br />
Temptation's page flies out the door<br />
You follow, find yourself at war<br />
Watch waterfalls of pity roar<br />
You feel to moan but unlike before<br />
You discover<br />
That you'd just be<br />
One more person crying.<br />
<br />
So don't fear if you hear<br />
A foreign sound to your ear<br />
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.<br />
<br />
As some warn victory, some downfall<br />
Private reasons great or small<br />
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call<br />
To make all that should be killed to crawl<br />
While others say don't hate nothing at all<br />
Except hatred.<br />
<br />
Disillusioned words like bullets bark<br />
As human gods aim for their mark<br />
Made everything from toy guns that spark<br />
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark<br />
It's easy to see without looking too far<br />
That not much<br />
Is really sacred.<br />
<br />
While preachers preach of evil fates<br />
Teachers teach that knowledge waits<br />
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates<br />
Goodness hides behind its gates<br />
But even the president of the United States<br />
Sometimes must have<br />
To stand naked.<br />
<br />
An' though the rules of the road have been lodged<br />
It's only people's games that you got to dodge<br />
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.<br />
<br />
Advertising signs that con you<br />
Into thinking you're the one<br />
That can do what's never been done<br />
That can win what's never been won<br />
Meantime life outside goes on<br />
All around you.<br />
<br />
You lose yourself, you reappear<br />
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear<br />
Alone you stand with nobody near<br />
When a trembling distant voice, unclear<br />
Startles your sleeping ears to hear<br />
<br>
That somebody thinks<br />
They really found you.<br />
<br />
A question in your nerves is lit<br />
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy<br />
Insure you not to quit<br />
To keep it in your mind and not forget<br />
That it is not he or she or them or it<br />
That you belong to.<br />
<br />
Although the masters make the rules<br />
For the wise men and the fools<br />
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.<br />
<br />
For them that must obey authority<br />
That they do not respect in any degree<br />
Who despise their jobs, their destinies<br />
Speak jealously of them that are free<br />
Do what they do just to be<br />
Nothing more than something<br />
They invest in.<br />
<br />
While some on principles baptized<br />
To strict party platform ties<br />
Social clubs in drag disguise<br />
Outsiders they can freely criticize<br />
Tell nothing except who to idolize<br />
And then say God bless him.<br />
<br />
While one who sings with his tongue on fire<br />
Gargles in the rat race choir<br />
Bent out of shape from society's pliers<br />
Cares not to come up any higher<br />
But rather get you down in the hole<br />
That he's in.<br />
<br />
But I mean no harm nor put fault<br />
On anyone that lives in a vault<br />
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.<br />
<br />
Old lady judges watch people in pairs<br />
Limited in sex, they dare<br />
To push fake morals, insult and stare<br />
While money doesn't talk, it swears<br />
Obscenity, who really cares<br />
Propaganda, all is phony.<br />
<br />
While them that defend what they cannot see<br />
With a killer's pride, security<br />
It blows the minds most bitterly<br />
For them that think death's honesty<br />
Won't fall upon them naturally<br />
Life sometimes<br />
Must get lonely.<br />
<br />
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards<br />
False goals, I scuff<br />
At pettiness which plays so rough<br />
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs<br />
Kick my legs to crash it off<br />
Say okay, I have had enough<br />
What else can you show me?<br />
<br />
And if my thought-dreams could be seen<br />
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine<br />
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.</p>
