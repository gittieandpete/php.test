I never dreamed there could be<br />
A someone made just for me<br />
And I'm letting her have her way<br />
I'm here to see what she has to say<br />
Ah, the poor girl always wins the day<br />
I'm stayin' ahead of the game<br />
And she's a-doin' the same<br />
And the whiskey flyin' into my head<br />
The fiddler's arm has gone dead<br />
And talk is beginning to spread<br />
When did our love go bad<br />
Whatever happened to the best friend that I had<br />
It's been so long since I held you tight<br />
Been so long since we said good night<br />
The taste of tears is bittersweet<br />
When you're near me my heart forgets to beat<br />
You're there every night among the good and the true<br />
And I'll be 'round waiting for you<br />
<br>
Well the king of them all is starting to fall<br />
I lost my gal at the boatman's' ball<br />
The night has a thousand hearts and eyes<br />
Hope may vanish, but it never dies<br />
I'll see you tomorrow when freedom rings<br />
I'm gonna stay on top of things<br />
It's the middle of summer and the moon is blue<br />
And I'll be 'round waiting for you<br />
Well, another deal gone down<br />
Another man done gone<br />
You put up with it all<br />
And you carry on<br />
Something holding you back<br />
But you'll come through<br />
I'd bet the world and everything in it on you<br />
Happiness is but a state of mind<br />
Anytime you want you can cross the state line<br />
You don't need to be rich or well to do<br />
I'll be 'round waiting for you</p>
