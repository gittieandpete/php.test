Some of us turn off the lights and we live<br />
In the moonlight shooting by<br />
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark<br />
To be where the angels fly<br />
Pretty maids all in a row lined up<br />
Outside my cabin door<br />
I've never wanted any of them wanting me<br />
'Cept the girl from the Red River shore<br />
<br />
Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried<br />
To make that girl my wife<br />
She gave me her best advice and she said<br />
"Go home and lead a quiet life."<br />
Well, I've been to the east and I've been to the west<br />
And I've been out where the black winds roar<br />
Somehow, though, I never did get that far<br />
With the girl from the Red River shore<br />
<br />
Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her<br />
I could never be free<br />
One look at her and I knew right away<br />
She should always be with me<br />
Well, the dream dried up a long time ago<br />
Don't know where it is anymore<br />
True to life, true to me<br />
Was the girl from the Red River shore<br />
<br />
Now I'm wearing the cloak of misery<br />
And I've tasted jilted love<br />
And the frozen smile upon my face<br />
Fits me like a glove<br />
But I can't escape from the memory<br />
Of the one that I'll always adore<br />
All those nights when I lay in the arms<br />
Of the girl from the Red River shore<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past<br />
Trapped in the fires of time<br />
I've tried not to ever hurt anybody<br />
And to stay out of a life of crime<br />
And when it's all been said and done<br />
I never did know the score<br />
One more day is another day away<br />
From the girl from the Red River shore<br />
<br />
Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land<br />
But I know this is where I belong<br />
I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love<br />
And the hills will give me a song<br />
Though nothing looks familiar to me<br />
I know I've stayed here before<br />
Once, a thousand nights ago<br />
With the girl from the Red River shore<br />
<br />
Well, I went back to see about it once<br />
Went back to straighten it out<br />
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there<br />
Said they didn't know who I was talking about<br />
Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago<br />
I've had to fall back from the door<br />
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life<br />
With the girl from the Red River shore<br />
<br />
Now, I've heard of a guy who lived a long time ago<br />
A man full of sorrow and strife<br />
Whenever someone around him died and was dead<br />
He knew how to bring 'em on back to life<br />
Well, I don't know what kind of language he used<br />
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore<br />
Sometimes I think nobody ever saw me here at all<br />
