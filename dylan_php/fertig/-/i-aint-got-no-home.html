Well, I ain't got no home I'm just ramblin' round<br />
Just a ramblin' worker, go from town to town<br />
Police make it hard wherever I may go<br />
I ain't got no home in this world anymore<br />
<br />
All my brothers and my sisters have stranded on this road<br />
That's a hard ol' dusty road that a million feet have trod<br />
<br>
Rich men took our home and they drove us from our door<br />
Man can't feel at home in this world anymore<br />
<br />
Well, as I look around me it's funny and plain to see<br />
This wicked cruel world is a funny ol' place to be<br />
The gamblin' man is rich lord, the workin' man is poor<br />
Can't fit his home in this world anymore</p>
