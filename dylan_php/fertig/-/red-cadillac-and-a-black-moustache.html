Who you been lovin' since I been gone?<br />
A long tall man with a red coat on<br />
Good-for-nothing-baby you've been doin' me wrong<br />
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?<br />
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?<br />
<br />
Who's been playin' around with you<br />
A real cool cat with eyes of blue<br />
Triflin' baby are you being true<br />
Who's been foolin' around with you?<br />
<br>
Who's been foolin' around with you?<br />
<br />
Somebody saw you at the break of day<br />
Dinin' and a-dancin' in the cabaret<br />
He was long and tall, had plenty of cash<br />
He had a red cadillac and a black moustache<br />
<br />
He held your hand and he sang you a song<br />
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?<br />
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?</p>
