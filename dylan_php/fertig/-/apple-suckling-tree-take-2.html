Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
Underneath that tree<br />
There's just gonna be you and me<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
<br />
Old man down and caught and hooked down there<br />
Old man down and caught and hooked down there<br />
Old man down and caught and hooked<br />
Line up baby, y'all take a look<br />
Old man down and caught and hooked down there<br />
<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
Underneath that tree<br />
There's just gonna be you and me<br />
Underneath that apple suckling tree oh yeah!<br />
<br>
<br />
Now I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh<br />
Now I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh<br />
Hey, if I fall on your buryin' ground<br />
Didn't catch your name, but he had a hound<br />
Bad on down there on the avenue, oh yeah<br />
<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
Underneath that tree<br />
There's just gonna be you and me<br />
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah!<br />
Underneath that tree<br />
There's just gonna be you and me<br />
Underneath that apple suckling tree oh yeah!</p>
