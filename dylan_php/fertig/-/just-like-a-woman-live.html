Nobody feels any pain<br />
Tonight as I stand inside the rain<br />
Everybody knows<br />
That baby's got new clothes<br />
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows<br />
Have fallen from her curls<br />
She takes just like a woman<br />
And she aches just like a woman<br />
And she makes love just like a woman<br />
But she breaks just like a little girl<br />
Queen Mary, she's my friend<br />
Yes, I believe, I'll go see her again<br />
Nobody has to guess<br />
That baby can't be blessed<br />
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest<br />
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls<br />
She takes just like a woman<br />
<br>
And she aches just like a woman<br />
And she makes love just like a woman<br />
But she breaks just like a little girl<br />
It was raining from the first<br />
And I was dyin' of thirst, so I came in here<br />
And your long-time curse hurts<br />
But what's worse is this pain in here<br />
I can't stay in here, ain't it clear<br />
That I just don't fit<br />
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit<br />
When we meet again introduced as friends<br />
Please don't let on that you knew me when<br />
I was hungry and it was your world<br />
Well, you fake just like a woman<br />
And you take just like a woman<br />
Do you make love just like a woman?<br />
But you break just like a little girl</p>
