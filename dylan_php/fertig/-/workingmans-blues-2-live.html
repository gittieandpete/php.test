There's an evenin' haze settlin' over town<br />
Starlight by the edge of the creek<br />
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down<br />
Money's getting shallow and weak<br />
Well the place I love best is a sweet memory<br />
It's a new path that we trod<br />
They say low wages are reality<br />
If we want to compete abroad<br />
<br />
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf<br />
Come sit down on my knee<br />
You are dearer to me than myself<br />
As you yourself can see<br />
While I'm listenin' to the steel rails a'hum<br />
Got both eyes tight shut<br />
Just sittin' here trying to keep the hunger from<br />
Creeping its way into my gut<br />
<br />
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind<br />
Bring me my boots and shoes<br />
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line<br />
Sing a little bit of these workingman blues<br />
<br />
Well, I'm sailin' on back<br />
Gettin' ready for the long haul<br />
I'm leaving everythin' behind<br />
If I stay here I could lose it all<br />
The bandits'll rob me blind<br />
I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought<br />
I'm gonna sleep off the rest of the day<br />
Sometime nobody want what you got<br />
Sometime you can't give it away<br />
<br />
I woke up this morning<br />
And I sprung to my feet<br />
And I went into town on a whim<br />
I saw my father in the street<br />
At least I think it was him<br />
In the dark I hear a song bird call<br />
You know the hills are rugged and steep<br />
But I'll sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall<br />
If I told you my whole story you'd weep<br />
<br />
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind<br />
Bring me my boots and shoes<br />
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line<br />
Sing a little bit of these workingman blues<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse<br />
I can't save a dime<br />
It's a long way down, I don't want to be forced<br />
Into a life of continual crime<br />
I can see for myself that the sun is sinkin'<br />
Over the deep blue sea<br />
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinkin'<br />
That you have forgotten me?<br />
<br />
Now, they worry and they hurry<br />
Tthey fuss and they fret<br />
They waste your nights and days<br />
Them I will forget<br />
But you I'll remember always<br />
It's a cold black night, and it's midsummer's eve<br />
And the stars are spinnin' around<br />
I'm still finding it so hard to believe<br />
Someone would kick me when I'm down<br />
<br />
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind<br />
Bring me my boots and shoes<br />
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line<br />
Sing a little bit of these workingman blues<br />
<br />
I'll be back home in a month or two<br />
When the frost is on the vine<br />
I'm gonna punch my spear right straight through<br />
Half-ways down his spine<br />
Then I'll lift my arms to the star-lit skies<br />
And I'll pray the fugitive prayer<br />
I'm guessin' tomorrow the sun will rise<br />
I hope the final end's been spared<br />
<br />
Now the battle is over, up in the hills<br />
And the mist is settlin' in<br />
Look at me with all my spoils<br />
What did I ever win?<br />
I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife<br />
I can live on rice and beans<br />
Some people never work a day in their life<br />
They don't know what work even means<br />
<br />
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind<br />
Bring me my boots and shoes<br />
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line<br />
Sing a little bit of these workingman blues</p>
