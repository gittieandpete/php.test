I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around<br />
Well, I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown<br />
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by<br />
My love for her is taking such a long time to die<br />
<br />
I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist<br />
It's almost like, almost like I don't exist<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound<br />
<br />
The walls of pride are high and wide<br />
Can't see over to the other side<br />
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay<br />
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away<br />
<br />
One look at you and I'm out of control<br />
Like the universe has swallowed me whole<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound<br />
<br />
There's too many people, too many to recall<br />
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all<br />
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud<br />
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood<br />
<br />
<br>
I found my world, found my world in you<br />
But your love just hasn't proved true<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound<br />
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound<br />
<br />
Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds<br />
Reality has always had too many heads<br />
Some things last longer than you think they will<br />
Some kind of things you can never kill<br />
<br />
'Cause it's you and you only I been thinking about<br />
But you can't see in and it's hard lookin' out<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound<br />
<br />
Well, the fats in the fire and the water's in the tank<br />
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank<br />
I tried to love and protect you because I cared<br />
I'm gonna remember forever the joy that we shared<br />
<br />
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee<br />
You have no idea what you do to me<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound<br />
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound</p>
