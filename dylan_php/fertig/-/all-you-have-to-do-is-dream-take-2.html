If the farmer has no silo<br />
And his fuel cost runs up high<br />
Well, that's just how much I would love you<br />
If you'd just only let me try<br />
<br />
In some nice young up to date kitchen<br />
Let us get acquainted, dear<br />
And them old floor birds will just quit eatin'<br />
And just grin from ear to ear<br />
<br />
Two floor birds and a prudent baby chick<br />
Yes that ain't, that ain't much to bust<br />
But restriction causes damage<br />
And damage causes lust<br />
<br />
So poor little girl, come blow this horn<br />
<br>
Hard as any whole night seems<br />
It's very easily done actually<br />
All you have to do is dream<br />
<br />
Well, them old back scrapers are a dime a dozen<br />
And I can get a call for a nickle<br />
Yes, but look what an earful I get and it's all awful too<br />
Every time I try to go get me a little tickle<br />
<br />
So, gimme one sweet loaf of bread<br />
Just one sweet loaf, fill it up and I'll be gone<br />
Yes, just like some of these old floor birds<br />
Who fly from dawn to dawn<br />
Oh yes, who fly from dawn to dawn<br />
Yes, who fly from dawn to dawn<br />
Oh, fly from dawn to dawn</p>
