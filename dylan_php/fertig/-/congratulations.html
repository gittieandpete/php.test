Congratulations for breaking my heart<br />
Congratulations for tearing it all apart<br />
Congratulations, you finally did succeed<br />
Congratulations for leaving me in need<br />
<br />
This morning I looked out my window and found<br />
A bluebird singing but there was no one around<br />
At night I lay alone in my bed<br />
With an image of you goin' around in my head<br />
<br />
Congratulations for bringing me down<br />
Congratulations, now I'm sorrow bound<br />
Congratulations, you got a good deal<br />
Congratulations, how good you must feel<br />
<br>
<br />
I guess I must have loved you more than I ever knew<br />
My world is empty now 'cause it don't have you<br />
And if I had just one more chance to win your heart again<br />
I would do things differently, but what's the use to pretend?<br />
<br />
Congratulations for making me wait<br />
Congratulations, now it's too late<br />
Congratulations, you came out on top<br />
Congratulations, you never did know when to stop<br />
<br />
Congratulations<br />
Congratulations<br />
Congratulations<br />
Congratulations</p>
