In the lonely night<br />
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light<br />
You're comin' thru to me in black and white<br />
When we were made of dreams<br />
<br />
You're blowing down the shaky street<br />
You're hearing my heart beat<br />
In the record breaking heat<br />
Where we were born in time<br />
<br />
Not one more night, not one more kiss<br />
Not this time baby, no more of this<br />
Takes too much skill, takes too much will<br />
It's revealing<br />
You came, you saw, just like the law<br />
You married young, just like your ma<br />
You tried and tried, you made me slide<br />
You left me reelin' with this feelin'<br />
<br>
<br />
On the rising curve<br />
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve<br />
You won't get anything you don't deserve<br />
Where we were born in time<br />
<br />
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice<br />
You hang the flame, you'll pay the price<br />
Oh babe, that fire<br />
Is still smokin'<br />
You were snow, you were rain<br />
You were striped, you were plain<br />
Oh babe, truer words<br />
Have not been spoken or broken<br />
<br />
In the hills of mystery<br />
In the foggy web of destiny<br />
You can have what's left of me<br />
Where we were born in time</p>
