I forgot to remember to forget her<br />
I can't seem to get her off my mind<br />
I thought I'd never miss her<br />
But I found out somehow<br />
I think about her almost all the time<br />
The day she went away<br />
I made myself a promise<br />
That I'd soon forget we ever met<br />
<br>
But something sure is wrong<br />
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely<br />
I forgot to remember to forget<br />
The day she went away<br />
I made myself a promise<br />
That I'd soon forget we ever met<br />
Well, but something sure is wrong<br />
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely<br />
I forgot to remember to forget</p>
