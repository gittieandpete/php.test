Well, you asked me if I'll forget my baby<br />
I guess I will, someday<br />
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way<br />
You asked me if I'll get along<br />
I guess I will, someway<br />
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way<br />
<br />
God gave me that girl to lean on<br />
Then he put me on my own<br />
Heaven, help me be a man and<br />
Have the strength to stand alone<br />
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way<br />
<br>
<br />
You asked me if I'll miss her kisses<br />
I guess I will, everyday<br />
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way<br />
You asked me if I'll find another<br />
I don't know; I can't say<br />
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way<br />
<br />
God gave me that girl to lean on<br />
Then he put me on my own<br />
Heaven, help me be a man and<br />
Have the strength to stand alone<br />
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way</p>
