Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun<br />
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one<br />
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors<br />
But I will always be emotionally yours<br />
Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart<br />
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start<br />
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for<br />
And I will always be emotionally yours<br />
<br>
It's like my whole life never happened<br />
When I see you, it's as if I never had a thought<br />
I know this dream, it might be crazy<br />
But it's the only one I've got, okay<br />
Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied<br />
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide<br />
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores<br />
But I will always be emotionally yours</p>
