'Twas in the town of Griffin<br />
In the year of sixty-five<br />
A well known famous drover<br />
Stepped up to me and talked<br />
Sayin' "How do you do, young cowboy<br />
And how'd you like to go<br />
Spend the summer pleasantly<br />
In the hills of Mexico"<br />
<br />
Well, me being out of work right then<br />
To this drover I did say<br />
<br>
"Well, this going out on the buffalo range<br />
Depends on your pay<br />
But if you pay good wages<br />
Transportation to and fro<br />
I think I might go with you<br />
To the hills of Mexico"<br />
<br />
Well, we crossed the ?? river, boys<br />
Our troubles they begun<br />
Lightening, flashlight, hell-fire<br />
Had made the cattle run<br />
I tread towards the hiding place<br />
??<br />
Comanches waiting to pick us off<br />
On the hills of Mexico</p>
