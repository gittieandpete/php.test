Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"<br />
Abe say, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"<br />
God say, "No," Abe say, "What?"<br />
God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but<br />
The next time you see me comin', you better run"<br />
<br />
Well, Abe said, "Where do you want this killin' done?"<br />
God said, "Out on Highway 61"<br />
<br />
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose<br />
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes<br />
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"<br />
Howard said, "There's only one place I know"<br />
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man, I got to run"<br />
<br />
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun<br />
And said, "That way down on Highway 61"<br />
<br />
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King<br />
"I got forty red white and blue shoe strings<br />
And a thousand telephones that don't ring<br />
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"<br />
<br>
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son"<br />
<br />
And he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done<br />
Just take everything down to Highway 61"<br />
<br />
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night<br />
Told the first father that things weren't right<br />
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white"<br />
He said, "Come here and step into the light" he says, "Hmm, you're right<br />
Let me tell the second mother this has been done"<br />
<br />
But the second mother was with the seventh son<br />
And they were both out on Highway 61<br />
<br />
Now the rovin' gambler, he was very bored<br />
Tryin' to create a next world war<br />
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor<br />
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before<br />
But yes, I think it can be very easily done<br />
<br />
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun<br />
And have it on Highway 61"</p>
