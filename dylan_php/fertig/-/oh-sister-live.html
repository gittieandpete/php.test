Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms<br />
You should not treat me like a stranger<br />
Our Father would not like the way that you act<br />
And you must realize the danger<br />
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you<br />
And one deserving of affection?<br />
And is our purpose not the same on this earth<br />
To love and follow His direction?<br />
<br>
We grew up together<br />
From the cradle to the grave<br />
We died and were reborn<br />
And then mysteriously saved<br />
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door<br />
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow<br />
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore<br />
You may not see me tomorrow</p>
