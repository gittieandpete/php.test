Our conversation was short and sweet<br />
It nearly swept me offa my feet<br />
And I'm back in the rain<br />
Oh, and you are on dry land<br />
You made it there somehow<br />
You're a big girl now<br />
<br />
Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence<br />
He's singing his song for me at his own expense<br />
And I'm just like that bird<br />
Oh, singing just for you<br />
I hope that you can hear<br />
Hear me singing through these tears<br />
<br />
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast<br />
Oh but what a shame, that all we've shared can't last<br />
I can change I swear<br />
<br>
Oh, see what you can do<br />
I can make it through<br />
You can make it too<br />
<br />
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase<br />
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days<br />
Oh I know where I can find you<br />
Oh, in somebody's room<br />
It's a price I have to pay<br />
You're a big girl all the way<br />
<br />
A change in the weather is known to be extreme<br />
But what's the sense in changing horses in midstream<br />
I'm going out of my mind<br />
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts<br />
Like a corkscrew to my heart<br />
Ever since we've been apart</p>
