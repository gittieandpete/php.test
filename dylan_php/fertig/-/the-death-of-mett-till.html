Was down in Mississippi not so long ago<br />
When a young boy from Chicago town<br />
Walked in a Southern door<br />
This boy's fateful tragedy<br />
You all should remember well<br />
The color of his skin was black<br />
And his name was Emmett Till<br />
Some men, they dragged him to a barn<br />
And there they beat him up<br />
They said they had a reason<br />
But disremember what<br />
They tortured him and did some things<br />
Too evil to repeat<br />
There were screaming sounds inside the barn<br />
There was laughing sounds out on the street<br />
Then they rolled his body down a gulf<br />
Amidst a blood red rain<br />
And they threw him in the waters wide<br />
To cease his screaming pain<br />
The reason that they killed him there<br />
And I'm a-sure, it ain't no lie<br />
'Cause he was born in black-skin barn<br />
He was born to die<br />
And then to stop the United States<br />
Of yelling for a trial<br />
Two brothers, they confessed<br />
That they had killed poor Emmett Till<br />
But on the jury there were men<br />
<br>
Who had helped the brothers commit this awful crime<br />
And so this trial was a mockery<br />
But nobody there seemed to mind<br />
I saw the morning papers<br />
But I could not bear<br />
To see smiling brothers<br />
Walkin' down the courthouse stairs<br />
For the jury found them innocent<br />
And the brothers, they went free<br />
While Emmett's body floats the foam<br />
Of a Jim Crow southern sea<br />
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing<br />
A crime that's so unjust<br />
Your eyes are filled with dead men's clay<br />
Your ears must be filled with dust<br />
Your arms and legs<br />
They must be in shackles and chains<br />
And your mind, it must cease to flow<br />
For you to let our human race<br />
Fall down so God-awful low<br />
This song is just a reminder<br />
To remind your fellow man<br />
That this kind of thing still lives today<br />
In that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan<br />
But if all of us folks that thinks alike<br />
If we gave all we could give<br />
We could make this great land of ours<br />
A greater place to live</p>
