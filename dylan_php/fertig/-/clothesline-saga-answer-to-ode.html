After a while we took in the clothes<br />
Nobody said very much<br />
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants<br />
Which nobody really wanted to touch<br />
Mama come in and picked up a book<br />
An' Papa asked her what it was<br />
Someone else asked, "What do you care?"<br />
Papa said, "Well, just because.."<br />
Then they started to take back their clothes<br />
Hang'em on the line<br />
It was January the thirtieth<br />
And everybody was feelin' fine<br />
<br />
The next day, everybody got up<br />
Seein' if the clothes were dry<br />
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed<br />
Mama, of cource, she said, "Hi"<br />
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin<br />
<br>
"The Vice President's gone mad!"<br />
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night."<br />
"Hmm, say, that's too bad"<br />
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor<br />
"It's just something we're gonna have to forget"<br />
"Yes, I guess so" said Ma<br />
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet<br />
<br />
I reached up, touched my shirt<br />
And the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"<br />
I said, "Some of them, not all of them"<br />
He said, "Ya always help out around here with the chores ?"<br />
I said, "Sometime, not all the time"<br />
And my neighbor he blew his nose<br />
Just as papa yelled outside<br />
"Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes"<br />
Well, I just do what I'm told so I did it, of course<br />
I went back in the house and Mama met me<br />
And then I shut all the doors</p>
