I'm a man of constant sorrow<br />
I've seen trouble all my days<br />
I'll say, goodbye to Colorado<br />
Where I was born and partly raised<br />
Your mother says, I'm a stranger<br />
My face you'll never see, no more<br />
But there's one promise, darlin'<br />
I'll see you on Gods golden shore<br />
<br>
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble<br />
Through ice and snows, sleet and rain<br />
I'm bound to ride that mornin' railroad<br />
Perhaps I'll die on that train<br />
I'm goin' back to Colorado<br />
The place that I've started from<br />
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me<br />
Honey, I never would have come</p>
