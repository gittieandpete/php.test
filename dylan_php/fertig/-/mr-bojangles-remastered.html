I knew a man bojangles and he'd dance for you<br />
In worn out shoes<br />
The silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants<br />
That old soft shoe<br />
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high<br />
Then he'd lightly touch down<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Dance<br />
I met him in a cell in new orleans<br />
I was down and out<br />
He looked to me to be the eyes of age<br />
As he spoke right out<br />
He talked of life, he talked of life<br />
Laughed and slapped his leg a step<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Dance<br />
He said the name bojangles then he danced a lick<br />
All across the cell<br />
He grabbed his pants for a better stance<br />
Oh he jumped so high and clicked up his heels<br />
He let go laugh, he let go laugh<br />
Shook back his clothes all around<br />
<br>
Mister bojangles<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Dance<br />
Yeah, dance<br />
<br />
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs<br />
Throughout the south<br />
He spoke with tears of fifteen years<br />
How his dog 'n him had just travelled all about<br />
His dog up and died, he up and died<br />
And after twenty years he still grieves<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Dance<br />
He said i dance now at every chance in honky tonks<br />
For drinks and tips<br />
But most of the time i spend behind these county bars<br />
Cause i drinks a bit<br />
He shook his head, and then he shook his head<br />
I heard someone ask him: "please"<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Mister bojangles<br />
Dance<br />
Mister bojangles dance</p>
