Been beat up and battered around<br />
Been sent up, and I've been shot down<br />
You're the best thing that I've ever found<br />
Handle me with care<br />
<br />
Reputation's changeable<br />
Situation's tolerable<br />
But baby, you're adorable<br />
Handle me with care<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus- Roy Orbison]<br />
I'm so tired of being lonely<br />
I still have some love to give<br />
Won't you show me that you really care?<br />
<br />
[Chorus- Bob Dylan and Tom Petty]<br />
Everybody's got somebody to lean on<br />
Put your body next to mine, and dream on<br />
<br>
<br />
I've been fobbed off, and I've been fooled<br />
I've been robbed and ridiculed<br />
In day care centres and night schools<br />
Handle me with care<br />
<br />
Been stuck in airports, terrorized<br />
Sent to meetings, hypnotized<br />
Overexposed, commercialized<br />
Handle me with care<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
<br />
[Chorus- Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison]<br />
<br />
I've been uptight and made a mess<br />
But I'll clean it up myself, I guess<br />
Oh, the sweet smell of success<br />
Handle me with care</p>
