Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell<br />
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell<br />
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell<br />
<br />
She had sweethearts a-plenty and men of high degree<br />
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be<br />
Oh, her true love e'er to be<br />
<br />
"Oh daughter, oh daughter, your body I will confine<br />
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind<br />
Oh, would ever suit your mind<br />
<br />
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine<br />
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine<br />
Oh, would have this heart of mine<br />
<br />
Now Jackie's gone sailing with trouble on his mind<br />
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind<br />
Oh, his darling girl behind<br />
<br />
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array<br />
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away<br />
Oh, convey herself away<br />
<br>
<br />
"Before you step onboard, sir, your name I'd like to know."<br />
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe<br />
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."<br />
<br />
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small<br />
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball<br />
Oh, to face the cannonball<br />
<br />
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small<br />
But they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall<br />
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."<br />
<br />
The war soon being over, they hunted all around<br />
Among the dead and dying her darling love she found<br />
Oh, her darling love she found<br />
<br />
She picked him up all in her arms and carries him to town<br />
And sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds<br />
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds<br />
<br />
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree<br />
This couple they got married, so why not you and me<br />
Oh, so why not you and me</p>
