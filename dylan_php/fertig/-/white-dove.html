In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia<br />
There's a place that I love so well<br />
Where I spent many days of my childhood<br />
In the cabin where we loved to dwell<br />
White dove will mourn in sorrow<br />
The willows will hang their heads<br />
I'll live my life in sorrow<br />
Since mother and daddy are dead<br />
<br>
We were all so happy there together<br />
In our peaceful little mountain home<br />
But the Savior needs angels up in heaven<br />
Now they sing around the great white throne<br />
As the years roll by I often wonder<br />
If we will all be together someday<br />
And each night as I wander through the graveyard<br />
Darkness finds me as I kneel to pray</p>
