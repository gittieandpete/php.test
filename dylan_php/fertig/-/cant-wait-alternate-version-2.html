I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind<br />
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line<br />
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around<br />
Some on their way up, some on their way down<br />
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
<br />
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew<br />
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you<br />
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm reeling from the blow<br />
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so<br />
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate<br />
But I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
<br />
Skies are grey, I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow<br />
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore; I just go<br />
<br>
If I ever saw you coming I don't know what I might do<br />
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true<br />
That's how it is when things disintegrate<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
<br />
I'm doomed to love you<br />
I've been rolling through stormy weather<br />
I'm thinking of you<br />
And all the places we could roam together<br />
<br />
It's mighty funny; the end of time has just begun<br />
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one<br />
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind<br />
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line<br />
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate<br />
But I don't know how much longer I can wait</p>
