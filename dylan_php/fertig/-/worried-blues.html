I got those worried blues<br />
And I got those worried blues<br />
I got those worried blues<br />
I got those worried blues, Lord<br />
I'm going where I never been before<br />
<br />
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow<br />
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow<br />
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow<br />
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow<br />
I'm going where the climate suit my clothes<br />
<br>
<br />
Honey baby don't leave me now<br />
Honey baby don't leave me now<br />
Oh honey baby don't leave me now<br />
Honey baby don't leave me now<br />
I got trouble in my mind<br />
<br />
Listen to that cold whistle blow, Lord<br />
Listen to that cold whistle blow<br />
Listen to that cold whistle blow<br />
Listen to that cold whistle blow<br />
I'm going where I never been before</p>
