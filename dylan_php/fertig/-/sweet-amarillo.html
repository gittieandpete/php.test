Well the world's greatest wonder from what I can tell<br />
Is how a cowgirl like you could ever look my way<br />
I was blinded by glory with a half-written story<br />
And a song spilling out off of every page<br />
<br />
Sweet Amarillo<br />
Tears on my pillow<br />
You never will know<br />
How much I cried<br />
Sweet Amarillo<br />
Like the wind in the willow<br />
Damn this old cowboy<br />
For my foolish pride<br />
<br />
So I drifted on down from the Iron Ore Range<br />
Across the wide Missouri where the cool waters flow<br />
When I got to Topeka I looked up your name<br />
But they said you rode off with the last rodeo<br />
<br />
Sweet Amarillo<br />
Tears on my pillow<br />
You never will know<br />
How much I cried<br />
Sweet Amarillo<br />
<br>
Like the wind in the willows<br />
Damn this old cowboy<br />
For my foolish pride<br />
<br />
Well the thunder's a-rumbling and the tumbleweed's tumbling<br />
And the rodeo clowns are painting their face<br />
I'm gunning the throttle for Ilano Estacado<br />
On a wild Appaloosa I'm blowing your way<br />
<br />
Down in Old Amarillo there's a light in the window<br />
Where a road weary shadow drifts into the arms<br />
Of a long distance lover then they turn back the covers<br />
And dance the Redova 'til the light of the dawn<br />
<br />
Sweet Amarillo<br />
Tears on my pillow<br />
You never will know<br />
How much I cried<br />
Sweet Amarillo<br />
Like the wind in the willows<br />
Damn this old cowboy<br />
For my foolish pride<br />
<br />
Sweet Amarillo<br />
Sweet Amarillo</p>
