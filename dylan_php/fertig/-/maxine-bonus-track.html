(1 2 3 4 5 6)<br />
<br />
It was late in the morning of November<br />
She was loading up the wagon in the rain<br />
She said she'd be back in the morning<br />
But she never came through here again<br />
<br />
I'd see her in the market<br />
She never had much to spend<br />
These days the market's an old parking lot<br />
And she never came through here again<br />
<br />
Maxine, Maxine, Maxine, Maxine<br />
<br />
Time plays tricks on your memory<br />
It's been a long weekend<br />
She said she'd be back here by Monday<br />
But never came through here again<br />
<br />
<br>
Some say a saucer landed<br />
And someone took her in<br />
They found her blue seraph here on the ground<br />
And she never came through here again<br />
<br />
Maxine, Maxine, Maxine, Maxine<br />
<br />
I bought a tabloid paper<br />
She was rumored to be in<br />
Was a photo of a woman on a llama<br />
But she never came through here again<br />
<br />
And if you should see her<br />
She may be old by then<br />
Tell her that I miss her and you can ask her when<br />
She's ever coming through here again<br />
<br />
Maxine, Maxine, Maxine, Maxine<br />
<br />
(Okay, that's it)</p>
