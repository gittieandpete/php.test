In the lonely night<br />
In the stardust of a pale blue light<br />
I think of you in black and white<br />
When we were made of dreams<br />
I walk along through the shaking street<br />
Listening to my heartbeat<br />
In the record-breaking heat<br />
When we were born in time<br />
Just when I thought you were gone, you came back<br />
Just when I was ready to receive ya<br />
You were smooth, you were rough<br />
You were more than enough<br />
Oh babe, why did I ever leave ya?<br />
Or grieve ya?<br />
<br>
On the rising curve<br />
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve<br />
I took you close and got what I deserve<br />
When we were born in time<br />
Just when I knew who to thank, you went blank<br />
Just when the firelight was gleaming<br />
You were snow, you were rain<br />
You were striped, you were plain<br />
Oh babe, can it be that you've been scheming?<br />
Or was I dreaming?<br />
In the hills of mystery<br />
In the foggy web of destiny<br />
You're still so deep inside of me<br />
When we were born in time</p>
