I pulled out for San Anton'<br />
I never felt so good<br />
My woman said she'd meet me there<br />
And of course, I knew she would<br />
The coachman, he hit me for my hook<br />
And he asked me my name<br />
I give it to him right away<br />
Then I hung my head in shame<br />
<br />
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!<br />
Lookin' for my lo and behold<br />
Get me outa here, my dear man!<br />
<br />
I come into Pittsburgh<br />
At six-thirty flat<br />
I found myself a vacant seat<br />
An' I put down my hat<br />
"What's the matter, Molly, dear<br />
What's the matter with your mound?"<br />
"What's it to ya, Moby Dick?<br />
This is chicken town!"<br />
<br />
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!<br />
Lookin' for my lo and behold<br />
Get me outa here, my dear man!<br />
<br>
<br />
I bought myself a herd of moose<br />
One she could call her own<br />
Well, she came out the very next day<br />
To see where they had flown<br />
I'm goin' down to Tennessee<br />
Get me a truck or somethin'<br />
Gonna save my money and rip it up!<br />
<br />
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!<br />
Lookin' for my lo and behold<br />
Get me outa here, my dear man!<br />
<br />
Now, I come in on a ferris wheel<br />
An' boys, I sure was slick<br />
I come in like a ton of bricks<br />
Laid a few tricks on 'em<br />
Goin' back to Pittsburgh<br />
Count up to thirty<br />
Round that horn and ride that herd<br />
Gonna thread up!<br />
<br />
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!<br />
Lookin' for my lo and behold<br />
Get me outa here, my dear man!</p>
