..on slim hands waiting<br />
Flash bright in candlelight till Sunday's early morn<br />
We found her room that rainy morning<br />
She took my hand through winding roads and led me home<br />
<br />
Some red French wine when later waiting<br />
In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair<br />
We talked of all, we talked of nothing<br />
<br>
I left with promises to meet, she told me where<br />
<br />
Oh, but she laughed each time I asked her name<br />
Made promises to meet again<br />
But her friends down at the French caf√©<br />
Had no English words for me<br />
<br />
So you may find above the border<br />
A girl with silver rings..</p>
