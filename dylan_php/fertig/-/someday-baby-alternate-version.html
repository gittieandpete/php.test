I don't care what you do, don't care what you say<br />
Don't care where you go, or how long you stay<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
You take my money and you turn me out<br />
You fill me up with self-doubt<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
You made me eat a ton of dust<br />
You're potentially dangerous and not worthy of trust<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
Little by little, bit by bit<br />
Every day I'm becomin' more of a hypocrite<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
You've got my mind tied up in knots<br />
I just keep recyclin' the same old thoughts<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
When I heard you was cold, I bought you a coat and hat<br />
<br>
I think you must have forgotten 'bout that<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
Gonna blow out your mind and make it pure<br />
I've taken about as much of this as I can endure<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
You put me down from a haver creak<br />
That's all right, to you i turn the other cheek<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
You say you need me, how would I know?<br />
You say you love me, but it can't be so<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
I don't wanna brag, but I'll wring your neck<br />
When all else fails, I'll make it a matter of self-respect<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more<br />
<br />
Livin' this way ain't a natural thing to do<br />
Why was I born to love you?<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more</p>
