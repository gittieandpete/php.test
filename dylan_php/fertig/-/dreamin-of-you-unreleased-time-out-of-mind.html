The light<br />
In this place<br />
Is really bad<br />
Like being<br />
In the bottom<br />
Of a stream<br />
Any minute now<br />
I'm expecting<br />
To wake up<br />
From a dream<br />
Miss so much<br />
The softest touch<br />
Like the grave<br />
Of some child child<br />
Who neither wept<br />
Nor smiled<br />
I'm hiding my faith<br />
In the rain<br />
I've been<br />
Dreamin' of you<br />
That's all I do<br />
And it's<br />
Driving me insane<br />
<br />
Somewhere dawn<br />
Is breaking<br />
Light is streaking<br />
Across the floor<br />
Church bells<br />
Are ringing<br />
I wonder who<br />
They're ringing for<br />
Travel under any star<br />
You'll see me<br />
Wherever you are<br />
<br />
The shadowy past<br />
Is so vague and so vast<br />
I'm sleeping<br />
In the balance of pain<br />
I've been dreamin' of you<br />
That's all I do<br />
But it's<br />
Driving me insane<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll get me<br />
Maybe they won't<br />
But whatever<br />
It won't be tonight<br />
I wish your hand<br />
Was in mine right now<br />
We could go<br />
Where the moon is wide<br />
<br />
For years<br />
They had me<br />
Locked in a cage<br />
<br>
Then they threw me<br />
Onto the stage<br />
Somethings<br />
Just last longer<br />
Then you<br />
Thought they would<br />
And they never<br />
Ever explain<br />
I'm dreamin' of you<br />
That's all I do<br />
And it's<br />
Driving me insane<br />
<br />
Well<br />
I eat when I'm hungry<br />
Drink when I'm dry<br />
Live my life<br />
On the square<br />
Even if the flesh<br />
Falls off my face<br />
It won't matter as long<br />
As you're there<br />
<br />
Feel like<br />
A ghost in love<br />
Underneath<br />
The heavens above<br />
Feel further away<br />
Then I ever did before<br />
Feel further<br />
Than I can take<br />
Dreamin' of you<br />
That's all I do<br />
But it's<br />
Driving me insane<br />
<br />
Everything in the way<br />
Is so shy like the day<br />
In queer and unusual form<br />
Spirals of golden haze here<br />
In there in a blaze<br />
Like beams of light<br />
In a star<br />
<br />
Maybe you're here<br />
Or maybe you weren't<br />
Maybe you<br />
Touched somebody<br />
And got burned<br />
The silent sun<br />
Has got me on the run<br />
Burning a hole<br />
In my brain<br />
I'm dreamin' of you<br />
That's all I do<br />
But it's<br />
Driving me insane</p>
