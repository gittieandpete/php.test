You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe<br />
But you're back where you belong<br />
Go get me my pistol, babe<br />
Honey, I'd ain't tell right from wrong<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying<br />
You know, I know, the sun will always shine<br />
But baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind<br />
Go down to the river, babe<br />
Honey, I will meet you there<br />
Go down to the river, babe<br />
Honey, I will pay your fare<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying<br />
You know, I know, the sun will always shine<br />
But baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind<br />
<br>
If you're looking for assistance, babe<br />
Or if you just want some company<br />
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to<br />
Honey, call me and see about me<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying<br />
You know, I know, the sun will always shine<br />
So baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind<br />
You been hurt so many times<br />
And I know what you're thinking of<br />
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe<br />
To see that you're madly in love<br />
But baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying<br />
Baby, please stop crying<br />
You know, I know, the sun will always shine<br />
So baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind</p>
