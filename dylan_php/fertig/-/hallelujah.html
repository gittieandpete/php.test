They say there was a secret chord<br />
That David played, and pleased the Lord<br />
You don't really care for music, do you?<br />
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth<br />
The minor fall, the major lifts<br />
The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br />
<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
<br />
You saw her bathing on the roof<br />
Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br />
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you<br />
She tied you to a kitchen chair<br />
She broke your faith, and she cut your hair<br />
And from your lips she drew the<br />
Hallelujah<br />
<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
<br>
<br />
Well you say I took the name in vain<br />
I didn't even know the name<br />
And if I did, well really, what's it to you?<br />
There's a blaze of light in every word<br />
It doesn't matter what you heard<br />
The broken or the holy Hallelujah<br />
<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
<br />
I did my best, it wasn't much<br />
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch<br />
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you<br />
And even though it all went wrong<br />
I'll stand before the Lord of Song<br />
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah<br />
<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah</p>
