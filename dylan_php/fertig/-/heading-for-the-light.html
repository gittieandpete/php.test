[Intro]<br />
<br />
[Verse 1: George Harrison]<br />
I've wandered around with nothing more than time on my hands<br />
I was lost in the night with no sight of you<br />
And at times it was so blue and lonely<br />
Heading for the light<br />
Been close to the edge, hanging by my fingernails<br />
I've rolled and I've tumbled through the roses and the thorns<br />
And I couldn't see the sign that warned me<br />
I'm heading for the light<br />
<br />
[Chorus 1: Jeff Lynne & Tom Petty]<br />
Ooh - I didn't see that big black cloud hanging over me<br />
And when the rain came down I was nearly drowned<br />
I didn't know the mess I was in<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway<br />
I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change<br />
And I get the strangest feeling<br />
As I'm heading for the light<br />
<br />
[Saxophone solo]<br />
<br />
<br>
[Chorus 2]<br />
Ooh - my hands were tired<br />
Jokers and fools on either side<br />
But still I kept on till the worst had gone<br />
Now I see the hole I was in<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway<br />
I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change<br />
And I get the strangest feeling<br />
As I'm heading for the light<br />
I see the sun ahead, I ain't never looking back<br />
All the dreams are coming true as I think of you<br />
Now there's nothing in the way to stop me<br />
Heading for the light<br />
<br />
[Tag]<br />
Now there's nothing in the way to stop me<br />
Heading for the light<br />
<br />
[Outro]<br />
Woah oh oh<br />
Woah oh oh<br />
Woah oh oh<br />
Heading for the light</p>
