I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
Well, I wake in the morning<br />
Fold my hands and pray for rain<br />
I got a head full of ideas<br />
That are drivin' me insane<br />
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor<br />
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more<br />
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more<br />
Well, he hands you a nickel<br />
He hands you a dime<br />
He asks you with a grin<br />
If you're havin' a good time<br />
Then he fines you every time you slam the door<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more<br />
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more<br />
Well, he puts his cigar<br />
Out in your face just for kicks<br />
<br>
His bedroom window<br />
It is made out of bricks<br />
The National Guard stands around his door<br />
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more<br />
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more<br />
Well, she talks to all the servants<br />
About man and God and law<br />
Everybody says<br />
She's the brains behind Pa<br />
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's fifty-four<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more<br />
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
Well, I try my best<br />
To be just like I am<br />
But everybody wants you<br />
To be just like them<br />
They sing while you slave and I just get bored<br />
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more</p>
