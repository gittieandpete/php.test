My name is Donald White, you see<br />
I stand before you all<br />
I was judged by you a murderer<br />
And the hangman's knot must fall<br />
I will die upon the gallows pole<br />
When the moon is shining clear<br />
And these are my final words<br />
That you will ever hear<br />
<br />
I left my home in Kansas<br />
When I was very young<br />
I landed in the old Northwest<br />
Seattle, Washington<br />
Although I'd a-traveled many miles<br />
I never made a friend<br />
For I could never get along in life<br />
With people that I met<br />
<br />
If I had some education<br />
To give me a decent start<br />
I might have been a doctor or<br />
A master in the arts<br />
But I used my hands for stealing<br />
When I was very young<br />
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells<br />
That's how my life begun<br />
<br />
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners<br />
I found they were my kind<br />
And it was there inside the bars<br />
I found my peace of mind<br />
But the jails they were too crowded<br />
Institutions overflowed<br />
So they turned me loose to walk upon<br />
Life's hurried tangled road<br />
<br />
And there's danger on the ocean<br />
Where the salt sea waves split high<br />
And there's danger on the battlefield<br />
Where the shells of bullets fly<br />
And there's danger in this open world<br />
Where men strive to be free<br />
And for me the greatest danger<br />
Was in society<br />
<br>
<br />
So I asked them to send me back<br />
To the institution home<br />
But they said they were too crowded<br />
For me they had no room<br />
I got down on my knees and begged<br />
"Oh, please put me away,"<br />
But they would not listen to my plea<br />
Or nothing I would say<br />
<br />
And so it was on Christmas eve<br />
In the year of '59<br />
It was on that night I killed a man<br />
I did not try to hide<br />
The jury found me guilty<br />
And I won't disagree<br />
For I knew that it would happen<br />
If I wasn't put away<br />
<br />
And I'm glad I've had no parents<br />
To care for me or cry<br />
For now they will never know<br />
The horrible death I die<br />
And I'm also glad I've had no friends<br />
To see me in disgrace<br />
For they'll never see that hangman's hood<br />
Wrap around my face<br />
<br />
Farewell unto the old north woods<br />
Of which I used to roam<br />
Farewell unto the crowded bars<br />
Of which've been my home<br />
Farewell to all you people<br />
Who think the worst of me<br />
I guess you'll feel much better when<br />
I'm on that hanging tree<br />
<br />
But there's just one question<br />
Before they kill me dead<br />
I'm wondering just how much<br />
To you I really said<br />
Concerning all the boys that come<br />
Down a road like me<br />
Are they enemies or victims<br />
Of your society?</p>
