Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop<br />
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'<br />
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins<br />
The hour that the ship comes in<br />
<br />
And the sea will split and the ships will hit<br />
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking<br />
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound<br />
And the morning will be a-breaking<br />
<br />
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path<br />
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling<br />
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand<br />
The hour that the ship comes in<br />
<br />
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused<br />
Will not be understood as they're spoken<br />
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night<br />
And be buried at the bottom of the ocean<br />
<br>
<br />
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts<br />
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline<br />
And the sun will respect every face on the deck<br />
The hour that the ship comes in<br />
<br />
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold<br />
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'<br />
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again<br />
That the whole wide world is watchin'<br />
<br />
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes<br />
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming<br />
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real<br />
The hour that the ship comes in<br />
<br />
And they'll raise their hands, saying "We'll meet all your demands"<br />
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered"<br />
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned in the tide<br />
And like Goliath they'll be conquered</p>
