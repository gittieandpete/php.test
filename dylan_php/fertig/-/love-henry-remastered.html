"Get down, get down, Love Henry," she cried<br />
"And stay all night with me<br />
I have gold chains, and the finest I have<br />
I'll apply them all to thee."<br />
<br />
"I can't get down and I shan't get down<br />
Or stay all night with thee<br />
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville<br />
I love far better than thee."<br />
<br />
He layed his head on a pillow of down<br />
Kisses she gave him three<br />
With a penny knife that she held in her hand<br />
She murdered mortal he<br />
<br />
"Get well, get well, Love Henry, " She cried<br />
"Get well, get well," said she<br />
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood<br />
Come flowin' down so free?"<br />
<br>
<br />
She took him by his long yellow hair<br />
And also by his feet<br />
She plunged him into well water, where<br />
It runs both cold and deep<br />
<br />
"Lie there, lie there, Love Henry," she cried<br />
"Til the flesh rots off your bones<br />
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville<br />
Will mourn for your return."<br />
<br />
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried<br />
"And light on my right knee<br />
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold<br />
And hung on a willow tree."<br />
<br />
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down<br />
And light on your right knee<br />
A girl who would murder her own true love<br />
Would kill a little birdlike me."</p>
