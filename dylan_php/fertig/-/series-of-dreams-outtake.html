I was thinking of a series of dreams<br />
Where nothing comes up to the top<br />
Everything stays down where it's wounded<br />
And comes to a permanent stop<br />
Wasn't thinking of anything specific<br />
Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams<br />
Nothing truly very scientific<br />
Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
Thinking of a series of dreams<br />
Where the time and the tempo drag<br />
And there's no exit in any direction<br />
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes<br />
Wasn't making any great connections<br />
Wasn't falling for any intricate schemes<br />
Nothing that would pass inspection<br />
Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
Dreams where the umbrella is folded<br />
And into the path you are hurled<br />
<br>
And the cards are no good that you're holding<br />
Unless they're from another world<br />
In one, the surface was frozen<br />
In another, I witnessed a crime<br />
In one, I was running, and in another<br />
All I seemed to be doing was crying<br />
Wasn't looking for any special assistance<br />
Not going to any great extremes<br />
I'd already gone the distance<br />
Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
Dreams where the umbrella is folded<br />
And into the path you are hurled<br />
And the cards are no good that you're holding<br />
Unless they're from another world<br />
I'd already gone the distance<br />
Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
Just thinking of a series of dreams</p>
