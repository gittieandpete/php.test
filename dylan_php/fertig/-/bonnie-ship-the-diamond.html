Well, the bonnie ship was a good old ship<br />
She was a-fishin' on a leading chain<br />
And me an' John, oh was a long catch on<br />
It was the last of the ones I've seen<br />
<br />
So with a sword and a rope in belt<br />
Feel all that your heart be sailed<br />
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes<br />
Fishin' for the whales<br />
<br />
Well, we feud all night, the cabin gauge<br />
It was a-more than feelin' bad<br />
And with all kind friends we watched in fear<br />
It was a naught time we ever had<br />
<br />
So it's rise up my lads<br />
Let your hearts never fail<br />
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes<br />
Fishin' for the whales<br />
<br>
<br />
And all day long at Vera Cruz<br />
We sailed [all the likes] to bind<br />
With no heavy moan, any hearts of stone<br />
No aid was tried for mine<br />
<br />
So it's cheer up my boys<br />
Let your hearts never fail<br />
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes<br />
Fishin' for the whales<br />
<br />
Well, now along cape Fate, 'twas lit in red<br />
All along cape Horn<br />
And from Vera Cruz we sailed ahead<br />
It was all in the time of storm<br />
<br />
So, it's cheer on up my boys<br />
Let your hearts never fail<br />
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes<br />
Fishin' for the whales</p>
