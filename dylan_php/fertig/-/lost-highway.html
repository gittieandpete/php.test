I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost<br />
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost<br />
When I pass by, all the people say<br />
"Just another guy on the lost highway."<br />
<br />
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine<br />
And a woman's lies make a life like mine<br />
Oh, the day we met, I went astray<br />
I started rollin' down that lost highway<br />
<br />
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two<br />
I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost<br />
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost<br />
When I pass by, all the people say<br />
"Just another guy on the lost highway."<br />
<br />
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine<br />
And a woman's lies make a life like mine<br />
<br>
Oh, the day we met, I went astray<br />
I started rollin' down that lost highway<br />
<br />
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two<br />
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you<br />
And now I'm lost, too late to pray<br />
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway<br />
<br />
Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round<br />
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound<br />
Take my advice or you'll curse the day<br />
You started rollin' down that lost highway<br />
And now I'm lost, too late to pray<br />
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway<br />
<br />
Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round<br />
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound<br />
Take my advice or you'll curse the day<br />
You started rollin' down that lost highway</p>
