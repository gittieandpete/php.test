By Bob Dylan and Helena Springs<br />
<br />
We have got to come together<br />
How long can we stay apart?<br />
You may get it maybe never<br />
But it's coming from the heart<br />
<br />
Your life is full of indecision<br />
You can't make up your mind<br />
We must get it in position<br />
And move it on down the line<br />
<br />
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb<br />
I been on that road too long of a time<br />
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds<br />
When I think of the love that I left behind<br />
<br />
Make me up a bed of roses<br />
And hang them down from the vine<br />
Of all my loves you've been the closest<br />
That's ever been on my mind<br />
<br />
Please don't talk about tomorrow<br />
<br>
I'm really not one to care<br />
This world is filled with too much sorrow<br />
That nobody's heart should bear<br />
<br />
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb<br />
I been on that road too long of a time<br />
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds<br />
When I think of the love that I left behind<br />
<br />
Please, please give me indication<br />
Stop and talk to me<br />
Like a river that is flowing<br />
My love will never cease to be<br />
<br />
You will always be my honey<br />
No one could take your part<br />
Our love can't be bought with money<br />
'Cause it's coming from the heart<br />
<br />
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb<br />
I been on that road too long of a time<br />
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds<br />
When I think of the love that I left behind</p>
