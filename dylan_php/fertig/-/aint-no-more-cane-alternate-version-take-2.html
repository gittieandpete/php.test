Ain't no more cane on the Brazos<br />
It's all been ground down to molasses<br />
<br />
You shoulda been on the river in 1910<br />
They were driving the women just like they drove the men<br />
<br />
Go down Old Hannah, don't you rise no more<br />
Don't you rise up 'til Judgment Day's for sure<br />
<br />
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos<br />
<br>
It's all been ground down to molasses<br />
<br />
Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old Shine<br />
Well, ya drove that bully 'til he went stone blind<br />
<br />
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head<br />
Well, you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead<br />
<br />
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos<br />
It's all been ground down to molasses</p>
