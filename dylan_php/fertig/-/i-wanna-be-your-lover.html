Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand<br />
And the judge says, &quot;mona can't have no bond.&quot;<br />
And the walls collide, mona cries,<br />
And the rainman leaves in the wolfman's disguise.<br />
<br />
I wanna be your lover, baby, i wanna be your man.<br />
I wanna be your lover, baby,<br />
I don't wanna be hers, i wanna be yours.<br />
<br />
Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit<br />
Says to the masked man, &quot;ain't you cute!&quot;<br />
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf<br />
And he says, &quot;you ain't so bad yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanna be your lover, baby, i wanna be your man.<br />
I wanna be your lover, baby,<br />
I don't wanna be hers, i wanna be yours.<br />
<br />
<br>
Well, jumpin' judy can't go no higher.<br />
She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire.<br />
Rasputin he's so dignified,<br />
He touched the back of her head an' he died.<br />
<br />
I wanna be your lover, baby, i wanna be your man.<br />
I wanna be your lover, baby,<br />
I don't wanna be hers, i wanna be yours.<br />
<br />
Well, phaedra with her looking glass,<br />
Stretchin' out upon the grass.<br />
She gets all messed up and she faints<br />
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't.<br />
<br />
I wanna be your lover, baby, i wanna be your man.<br />
I wanna be your lover, baby,<br />
I don't wanna be hers, i wanna be yours.<br />
