The sweetest girl in the world<br />
Is my blue-eyed Jane<br />
We fell in love like turtledoves<br />
While the moon was shining down<br />
I asked her then, I asked her when<br />
Wedding bells would ring<br />
She said, "Oh, dear, it seems so queer<br />
That this could happen here."<br />
<br />
You are my little pal<br />
And I never knew a sweeter gal<br />
My little blue-eyed Jane<br />
I love you so<br />
And when the sun goes down<br />
And the shadow's creeping over town<br />
Just meet me in the lane<br />
My blue-eyed Jane<br />
<br>
<br />
Janie dear, listen here<br />
I've come to say farewell<br />
The world is drear without you, dear<br />
But now I cannot linger here<br />
I'm going away this very day<br />
Oh please, come go with me<br />
I'll be sad and blue wanting you<br />
Longing all day through<br />
<br />
My little blue-eyed Jane<br />
You'll always be the same sweet thing<br />
I know you'll never change<br />
I love you so<br />
And when the sun goes down<br />
And the shadow's creeping over town<br />
Then I'll come back again<br />
My blue-eyed Jane</p>
