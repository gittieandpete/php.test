Cloud so swift the rain fallin' in<br />
Gonna see a movie called Gunga Din<br />
Pack up your money, pull up your tent in the wind<br />
You ain't a goin' no where<br />
<br />
Hoo wee, ride me high<br />
Tomorrow's the day my brides a'gonna come<br />
Hoo wee, are we gonna fly<br />
Down into the easy chair<br />
<br />
Genghis Khan and his brother Don<br />
Couldn't keep on keepin' on<br />
We'll climb that bridge after it's gone<br />
After we're way past it<br />
<br />
Hoo wee, ride me high<br />
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come<br />
<br>
Hoo wee, are we gonna fly<br />
Down into the easy chair, yeah<br />
<br />
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings<br />
A flute that toots and a bee that stings<br />
A sky that cries and a bird that flies<br />
A fish that walks and a dog that talks<br />
<br />
Hoo wee, ride me high<br />
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come<br />
Hoo wee, are we gonna fly<br />
Down into the easy chair<br />
<br />
Hoo wee, ride me high<br />
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come<br />
Hoo wee, are we gonna fly<br />
Down into the easy chair</p>
