Went out last night to take a little round<br />
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down<br />
I ran right home and I went to bed<br />
With a forty-four smokeless under my head<br />
<br />
I began to think what a deed I'd done<br />
I grabbed my hat and I began to run<br />
I made a god run but I ran too slow;<br />
 They overtook me down in Jericho<br />
<br />
Standing on a corner a ringin' my bell<br />
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville<br />
He said 'Young man is you name Brown?<br />
Remember you blowed Sadie down."<br />
<br />
"Oh yes sir, my name is Lee<br />
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree<br />
First degree and second degree<br />
<br>
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?"<br />
<br />
Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black<br />
They put me on a train and they sent me back<br />
I had no one to go my bail;<br />
They crammed me back into the county jail<br />
<br />
Oh, yes they did<br />
The judge and the jury they took their stand<br />
The judge had the papers in his right hand<br />
<br />
Forty-one days, forty-one nights;<br />
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes;<br />
Oh, no!<br />
<br />
Went out last night to take a little round<br />
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down<br />
I ran right home and I went to bed<br />
A forty-four smokeless under my head</p>
