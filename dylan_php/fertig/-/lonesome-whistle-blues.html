I was riding number 9<br />
Heading south from Carolina<br />
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow<br />
Got in trouble, had to roam<br />
Left my girl, left my home<br />
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow<br />
<br />
Just a kid, acting smart<br />
I went and broke my baby's heart<br />
I guess I was too young to know<br />
They took me off that Georgia Main<br />
And locked me to a ball and chain<br />
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow<br />
<br />
 All I do is sit and cry<br />
<br>
As the evening train goes by<br />
I heard that lonesome whistle blow<br />
I'll be locked here in this cell<br />
Till my body's just a shell<br />
And my head turns whiter than snow<br />
I'll never see that girl of mine<br />
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time<br />
I heard that lonesome whistle blow<br />
<br />
I'll be locked here in this cell<br />
Till my body's just a shell<br />
And my head turns whiter than snow<br />
I'll never see that girl of mine<br />
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time<br />
I heard that lonesome whistle blow</p>
