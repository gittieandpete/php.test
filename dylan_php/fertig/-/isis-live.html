I married Isis on the fifth day of May<br />
But I could not hold on to her very long<br />
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away<br />
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong<br />
<br />
I came to a high place of darkness and light<br />
The dividing line ran through the center of town<br />
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right<br />
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down<br />
<br />
A man in the corner approached me for a match<br />
I knew right away he was not ordinary<br />
He said, "Are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?"<br />
I said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."<br />
<br />
We set out that night for the cold in the North<br />
I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word<br />
I said, "Where are we goin'?" He said we'd be back by the fourth<br />
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."<br />
<br />
I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold<br />
I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace<br />
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold<br />
I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless<br />
<br />
How she told me that one day we would meet up again<br />
And things would be different the next time we wed<br />
If I only could hang on and just be her friend<br />
I still can't remember all the best things she said<br />
<br />
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice<br />
He said, "There's a body I'm tryin' to find<br />
<br>
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price."<br />
'Twas-a then that I knew what he had on his mind<br />
<br />
The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous<br />
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn<br />
When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious<br />
But I made up my mind that I had to go on<br />
<br />
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty<br />
There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had<br />
When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly<br />
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad<br />
<br />
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside<br />
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover<br />
I said a quick prayer then I felt satisfied<br />
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her<br />
<br />
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise<br />
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed<br />
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes<br />
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead<br />
<br />
She said, "Where ya been?" I said, "No place special."<br />
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."<br />
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."<br />
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes."<br />
<br />
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child<br />
What drives me to you is what drives me insane<br />
I still can remember the way that you smiled<br />
On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin' rain</p>
