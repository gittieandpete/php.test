Oh, my name, it ain't nothin', my age, it means less<br />
The country I come from is called the Midwest<br />
I's taught and brought up there, the laws to abide<br />
And that the land that I live in has God on its side<br />
<br />
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well<br />
The cavalries charged, the Indians died<br />
Oh, the country was young<br />
With God on its side<br />
<br />
The Spanish-American War had its day<br />
And the Civil War too was soon laid away<br />
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize<br />
With guns in their hands and God on their side<br />
<br />
The First World War, boys, it came and it went<br />
The reason for fighting I never did get<br />
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride<br />
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side<br />
<br />
The Second World War came to an end<br />
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends<br />
<br>
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried<br />
The Germans now too have God on their side<br />
<br />
I learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life<br />
If another war comes, it's them we must fight<br />
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide<br />
And accept it all bravely with God on my side<br />
<br />
But now we got weapons of chemical dust<br />
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must<br />
One push of the button and a shot the world wide<br />
You never ask questions when God's on your side<br />
<br />
Through many a dark hour I been thinkin' about this<br />
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss<br />
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide<br />
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side<br />
<br />
So now as I'm leavin', I'm weary as hell<br />
The confusion I'm feelin' ain't no tongue can tell<br />
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor<br />
That if God's on our side, he'll stop the next war</p>
