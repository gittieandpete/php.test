The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen<br />
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine<br />
Took a woman like you<br />
To get through to the man in me<br />
<br>
<br />
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling<br />
Just to know that you are near<br />
Sets my a heart a-reeling<br />
From my toes up to my ears</p>
