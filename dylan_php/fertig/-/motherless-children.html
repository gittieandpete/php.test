Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead<br />
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead<br />
Motherless children run a hard road, a hard road, a hard road<br />
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead<br />
<br />
Your father will do the best he can when your mother is dead<br />
Your father will do the best he can when your mother is dead<br />
Your father will do the best he can, but he just does not understand<br />
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead<br />
<br />
Now, there's some people say your sister might do when your mother is dead<br />
Now, there's some people say your sister might do when your mother is dead<br />
<br>
Some people say your sister will do; soon as she married, turn her back on you<br />
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead<br />
<br />
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade when I'm dead<br />
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade when I'm dead<br />
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade; see that my digger gets well paid<br />
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead<br />
<br />
Jesus won't be no mother to you when your mother is dead<br />
Jesus won't be no mother to you when your mother is dead<br />
Jesus won't be no mother to you; his trials and tribulations won't see you through<br />
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead</p>
