Well, I bought me a guitar, put it in tune<br />
Went out there the month of June<br />
'Twas a hot dog night and a stick in a roar<br />
Everybody was a-down on this side<br />
There was a holy cow (holy cow)<br />
Mean cow (mean cow)<br />
Double jaw (double jaw)<br />
Cow (cow)<br />
<br />
Well, I'll tell you a story about how to become<br />
An all American boy, you can beat on a drum<br />
Beat on a drum from five to six<br />
You'll be rock 'n' rollin' soon gettin' your kicks<br />
It's a good job (good job)<br />
Join the band (gigging in the band)<br />
Bring your hand (pick your hand)<br />
<br />
Clean your hand and come up tight<br />
Roll a smoke and down at night<br />
Hold on a train, on a whiskey jar<br />
Settle it down there you are<br />
Hold it steady<br />
Pick it up now<br />
Now hit it (makin' the girls giggle)<br />
<br />
Yes, you'll be makin' 'em little girlies giggle<br />
You'll be makin' 'em all just jump up an' down an' wiggle<br />
Empty their socks, in their britches<br />
All you'll find that soon you'll be itches<br />
Itches all over<br />
Itch in your pants<br />
Itch while you dance<br />
Itchin' on down to the corn' of France<br />
<br />
Well, I know a boy yesterday<br />
<br>
He become a guitar and he floated away<br />
He played his bars and he played 'em all<br />
He's just on there havin' a ball<br />
Kicking a hot storm up over the ocean<br />
He took himself a notion<br />
<br />
He got some lotion and<br />
He put it on his guitar, put it on him<br />
Next time you knew you can call him Jim<br />
Down the road, boy, they call him Slim<br />
They don't care if they're carry him<br />
Just a minute now, you'll see what I mean<br />
(Uncle Sam, in this land, rippin' up draft cards, an' all that)<br />
<br />
Well, sooner or later a man's gonna come<br />
He gonna take a look at you, look at your drum<br />
He'd be a man and he'll take you home<br />
Yeah, he'll take you out to his farm<br />
He'll give you a good one<br />
He'll give it to ya<br />
(Well, you meet, girls don't giggle no more)<br />
<br />
Well, sooner or later you're bound to meet his wife<br />
And you'll come in 'n' have the time of your life<br />
Just pickin' the gum, pickin' up a star<br />
Pickin' up goin' and goin' to the bar<br />
You and your manager (pickin' my nose)<br />
<br />
Well, you'll want to know about the manager soon<br />
He'll just take you outside and put you on the moon<br />
He'll buy you new clothes, new pair of shoes<br />
You'll be walk' away with the drummer blues<br />
You'd be a fine drummer<br />
Pick 'em as a comer<br />
Dog hummer</p>
