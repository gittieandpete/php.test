As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden<br />
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine<br />
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain<br />
Someone hit me from behind<br />
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
Through this weary world of woe<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
No one on earth would ever know<br />
<br />
They say prayer has the power to heal, so pray for me, mother<br />
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell<br />
I am trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others<br />
But oh, mother, things ain't going well<br />
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost<br />
<br />
Now I'm all worn down by weeping<br />
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry<br />
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping<br />
I will just slaughter 'em where they lie<br />
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
Through the world mysterious and vague<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
Walking through the cities of the plague<br />
<br />
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation<br />
The whole wide world which people say is round<br />
They will tear your mind away from contemplation<br />
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down<br />
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
Eating hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
Some day you'll be glad to have me around<br />
<br />
They will crush you with wealth and power<br />
Every waking moment you could crack<br />
I'll make the most of one last extra hour<br />
I'll avenge my father's death and I'll step back<br />
<br>
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
Hand me down my walking cane<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
Got to get you out of my miserable brain<br />
<br />
All my loyal and my much-loved companions<br />
They approve of me and share my code<br />
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned<br />
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road<br />
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
My mule is sick, my horse is blind<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
Thinking about that girl I left behind<br />
<br />
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying<br />
Fame and honor never seem to fade<br />
The fire gone out but the light is never dying<br />
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?<br />
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
Carrying a dead man's shield<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
Walking with a toothache in my heel<br />
<br />
The suffering is unending<br />
Every nook and cranny has its tears<br />
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending<br />
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears<br />
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
Walking ever since the other night<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
Walking till I'm clean out of sight<br />
<br />
As I walked out in the mystic garden<br />
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn<br />
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon<br />
There's no one here, the gardener is gone<br />
<br />
Ain't talking, just walking<br />
Up the road, around the bend<br />
Heart burning, still yearning<br />
In the last outback at the world's end</p>
