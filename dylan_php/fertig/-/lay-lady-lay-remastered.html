Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed<br />
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed<br />
Whatever colors you have in your mind<br />
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine<br />
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed<br />
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs<br />
Let's take a chance, who really cares<br />
Why don't you know, you got nothin' to prove<br />
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move<br />
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs<br />
<br>
Why wait any longer, I don't mean too complain?<br />
You can have love but you might lose it<br />
Why run any longer when you're runnin' in vain?<br />
You can have the truth but you got to choose it<br />
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile<br />
'Til the break of day, let me see you make him smile<br />
I long to see you in the morning light<br />
I long to hold you in the night<br />
Stay, lady, stay, stay with you man awhile<br />
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed</p>
