Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, little star<br />
Up comes Brady in a 'lectric car<br />
Got a mean look all 'round his eye<br />
Gonna shoot somebody jus' to see them die<br />
Duncan, Duncan was tending the bar<br />
In walked Brady with a shining star<br />
And Brady says, "Duncan you are under arrest"<br />
And Duncan shot a hole in Brady's breast<br />
Brady, Brady carried a .45<br />
Said it would shoot half a mile<br />
Duncan had a .44<br />
That what laid Mr. Brady so low<br />
<br>
Brady fell down on the barroom floor<br />
"Please Mr. Duncan don' shoot me no more"<br />
Women all cryin', ain't it a shame<br />
Shot King Brady, goin' shoot him again<br />
"Brady, Brady, Brady, you know you done wrong<br />
Walkin' in the room when the game was goin' on<br />
Knockin' down windows, breakin' down the door<br />
Now you lyin' dead on the grocery [barroom] floor<br />
Women all heard that Brady was dead<br />
Goes back home and they dresses in red<br />
Come a sniffin' and a sighin' down the street<br />
In their big mother hubbards and their stockin' feet<br />
'Cause he been on the job too long</p>
