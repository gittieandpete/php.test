You know I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den<br />
You know I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den<br />
I don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself<br />
<br />
You know you caught me crawlin'<br />
Baby, when the, when the grass was very high<br />
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die<br />
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den<br />
Don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself<br />
<br>
<br />
You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window, baby<br />
Wanna crawl up to your door; you got anything I want, baby?<br />
Wanna crawl up on your floor<br />
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den<br />
<br />
You know you caught me crawlin'<br />
Baby, when the, when the grass was very high<br />
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die<br />
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den</p>
