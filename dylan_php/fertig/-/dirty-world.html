He loves your sexy body, he loves your dirty mind<br />
He loves when you hold him, grab him from behind<br />
Oh baby, you're such a pretty thing<br />
I can't wait to introduce you to the other members of my gang<br />
<br />
You don't need no wax job, you're smooth enough for me<br />
If you need your oil changed, I'll do it for you free<br />
Oh baby, the pleasure would be all mine<br />
If you let me drive your pickup truck and park it where the sun don't shine<br />
<br />
Every time he touches you, his hair stands up on end<br />
His legs begin to quiver and his mind begins to bend<br />
Oh baby, you're such a tasty treat<br />
But I'm under doctor's orders, I'm afraid to overeat<br />
<br />
He love your sense of humor, disposition too<br />
There's absolutely nothing that he don't love about you<br />
Oh baby, I'm on my hands and knees<br />
Life would be so simple if I only had you to please<br />
Oh baby, turn around and say goodbye<br />
<br>
You go to the airport now and I'm going home and cry<br />
<br />
(He loves your) electric dumplings<br />
(He loves your) red bell peppers<br />
(He loves your) fuel injection<br />
(He loves your) service charge<br />
<br />
(He loves your) five-speed gearbox<br />
(He loves your) long endurance<br />
(He loves your) quest for junk food<br />
(He loves your) big refrigerator<br />
<br />
(He loves your) trembling wilbury<br />
(He loves your) marble earrings<br />
(He loves your) porky curtains<br />
(He loves your) power steering<br />
<br />
(He loves your) bottled water<br />
(He loves your) parts and service<br />
<br />
Dirty world, a dirty world, it's a fucking dirty world</p>
