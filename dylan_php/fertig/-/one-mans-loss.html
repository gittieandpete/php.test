[The first verse is inaudible]<br />
One man's loss always is another man's gain<br />
<br />
Let's take a cherry, I can't make it no more<br />
Can't stop, she's breaking all time on the floor<br />
Better come down easy or don't come down at all<br />
You don't try and to please me, somebody's gonna fall<br />
One man's loss always is another man's gain<br />
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain<br />
<br />
Eight o'clock in the morning, better step aside<br />
<br>
Let me be to your warning, you better go by<br />
Three times a loser, number 45<br />
Better not lose her, best stayed alive<br />
One man's loss always is another man's gain<br />
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain<br />
<br />
Wish I'd have found me (??) at the wall<br />
One look at the watch, you better lord at all<br />
You can't stop it or wait it (??) at night<br />
Too hard to keep you waiting, calls me aside<br />
One man's loss always is another man's gain<br />
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain</p>
