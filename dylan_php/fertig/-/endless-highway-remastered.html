Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket<br />
Never let it slip away<br />
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray<br />
When you get half crazy from the August heat<br />
Or on a frozen, rotted road<br />
With no one to complain to 'bout your achin' feet<br />
You're gonna walk that endless highway<br />
Walk that highway till you die<br />
All you children goin' my way<br />
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye<br />
When I see a detour up ahead<br />
Well, I leave it far behind<br />
Who knows what you're apt to find there<br />
With the cost of livin', and the price of dyin'<br />
<br>
Well it look like to me, this time I won't be buyin'<br />
You're gonna walk that endless highway<br />
Walk that highway till you die<br />
All you children goin' my way<br />
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye<br />
When they get a scapegoat by the throat<br />
It's hard labor and cold beans<br />
If you get away quick you'll be eatin' from the poison peanut machines<br />
Well, I sing by night, oh and wander by day<br />
I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay<br />
You're gonna walk that endless highway, endless highway<br />
Walk that highway till you die<br />
All you children goin' my way, goin' my way<br />
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye, yeah you tell 'em bye</p>
