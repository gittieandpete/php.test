I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind<br />
I can't wait, waiting is just making me go blind<br />
Do you ever lay awake at night, your faced turned to the wall?<br />
Drowning in your thoughtlessness and cut off from it all?<br />
I don't know, maybe for you, it's not that late<br />
But as for me, don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
It's got to end, everything about it just feels wrong<br />
I pretend being close to her is where I don't belong<br />
Well my back is to the sun because the light is too intense<br />
I can see what everybody in the world is up against<br />
I'll stay here where I can feed a hand of fate<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
Skies are gray, life is short and I think of her a lot<br />
<br>
I can't say if I want the pain to end or not<br />
Well the blindness overtaking me is beating like a drum<br />
I don't know where it starts or where it's coming from<br />
That's how it is when I try to concentrate<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
I been drinking, drinking forbidden juices<br />
I been living, living on lame excuses<br />
My hands are cold, the end of time has just begun<br />
I'm gettin' old, anything can happen now to anyone<br />
I walk all across the floor until I wear out my shoes<br />
When you think you've lost it all, there's always more to lose<br />
I'm so clear, she can keep my head up straight<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait</p>
