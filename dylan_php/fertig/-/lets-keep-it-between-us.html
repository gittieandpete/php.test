Let's keep it between us<br />
These people meddlin' in our affairs, they're not our friends<br />
Let's keep it between us<br />
Before doors close and our togetherness comes to an end<br />
They'll turn you against me and me against you 'til we don't know who to trust<br />
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?<br />
Let's keep it between us<br />
We've been through too much tough times that they never shared<br />
They've had nothing to say to us before<br />
Now all of a sudden it's as if they've always cared<br />
All we need is honesty, a little humility and trust<br />
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?<br />
I know we're not perfect<br />
Then again, neither are they<br />
They act like we got to live for them as if there just ain't no other way<br />
And it's makin' me kind of tired<br />
<br>
Can we just lay back for a moment<br />
Before we wake up and find ourselves in a daze that's got us out of our minds?<br />
There must be something we're overlooking here<br />
We better drop down now and get back behind the lines<br />
There's some things not fit for human ears, some things don't need to be discussed<br />
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?<br />
They'll tell you one thing and me another<br />
'Til we don't know who to trust<br />
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?<br />
Let's keep it between us<br />
Before it all snaps and goes too far<br />
If we can't deal with this by ourselves<br />
Tell me we ain't worse off than they think we are<br />
Backseat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel, but they sure know how to make a fuss<br />
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?<br />
Can we keep it between us?</p>
