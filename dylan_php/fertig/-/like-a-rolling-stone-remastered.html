Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br />
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?<br />
People call say 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'<br />
You thought they were all kidding you<br />
You used to laugh about<br />
Everybody that was hanging out<br />
Now you don't talk so loud<br />
Now you don't seem so proud<br />
About having to be scrounging your next meal<br />
How does it feel, how does it feel?<br />
To be without a home<br />
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone<br />
Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely<br />
But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br />
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street<br />
And now you're gonna have to get used to it<br />
You say you never compromise<br />
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br />
He's not selling any alibis<br />
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br />
And say do you want to make a deal?<br />
How does it feel, how does it feel?<br />
To be on your own, with no direction home<br />
A complete unknown, like a rolling stone<br />
<br>
Ah you never turned around to see the frowns<br />
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you<br />
You never understood that it ain't no good<br />
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you<br />
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat<br />
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br />
Ain't it hard when you discovered that<br />
He really wasn't where it's at<br />
After he took from you everything he could steal<br />
How does it feel, how does it feel?<br />
To have on your own, with no direction home<br />
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone<br />
Ahh princess on a steeple and all the pretty people<br />
They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made<br />
Exchanging all precious gifts<br />
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe<br />
You used to be so amused<br />
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br />
Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse<br />
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br />
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal<br />
How does it feel, ah how does it feel?<br />
To be on your own, with no direction home<br />
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone</p>
