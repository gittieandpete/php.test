Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow<br />
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row<br />
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point<br />
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint<br />
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?<br />
You're gonna have to find yourself<br />
Another best friend, somehow<br />
<br />
Now, don't you try an' move me, you're just gonna lose<br />
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you've been refused<br />
Well, it's sugar for sugar and salt for salt<br />
<br>
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault<br />
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?<br />
You're gonna have to find yourself<br />
Another best friend, somehow<br />
<br />
Well, that high tide's risin', mama, don't you let me down<br />
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound<br />
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen<br />
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen<br />
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?<br />
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself<br />
Another best friend, somehow</p>
