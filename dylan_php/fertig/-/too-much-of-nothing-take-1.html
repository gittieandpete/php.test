Now, too much of nothing<br />
Can make a man feel ill at ease<br />
One man's temper rises<br />
While another man's temper might freeze<br />
In the day of confession<br />
We cannot mock a soul<br />
Oh, when there's too much of nothing<br />
No one has control<br />
<br />
Say hello to Valerie<br />
Say hello to Vivian<br />
Send them all my salary<br />
On the waters of oblivion<br />
<br />
Too much of nothing<br />
Can cause a man to weep<br />
He can walk the streets like most supposed to<br />
But he'd like to keep<br />
Now, it's all been done before<br />
It's all been written in the book<br />
<br>
But when there's too much of nothing<br />
Nobody should look<br />
<br />
Say hello to Valerie<br />
Say hello to Vivian<br />
Send them all my salary<br />
On the waters of oblivion<br />
<br />
Too much of nothing<br />
Can make a man a liar<br />
It can cause one man to sleep on nails<br />
It can cause others to eat fire<br />
Ev'rybody's doin' somethin'<br />
I heard it in a dream<br />
But when there's too much of nothing<br />
It just makes a fella mean<br />
<br />
Say hello to Valerie<br />
Say hello to Vivian<br />
Send them all my salary<br />
On the waters of oblivion</p>
