... prayer<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
I am a teenage prayer<br />
When it's cloudy all the time<br />
All you gotta do is...<br />
<br />
(Take a look at me babe)<br />
(Good, go 'head)<br />
(I'm your teenage prayer)<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
(Just take a look at me baby)<br />
I am your teenage prayer<br />
(Yes I'm your teenage prayer)<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
(Just take a look over here at me baby)<br />
I am your teenage prayer<br />
(I'm your teenage prayer)<br />
<br />
Take a look and when it's cloudy all the time<br />
All you gotta do is say you're mine<br />
I come runnin' anywhere<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
(Just take a look at me baby)<br />
I'm your teenage prayer<br />
<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
I'm your teenage dream<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
I'm your teenage dream<br />
(Yes and I'm a dream)<br />
<br />
When it's rainy in your heart<br />
Just come to me and start<br />
Tell me how I do and cheer<br />
Oh, just come and take a look at me baby<br />
I'm your teenage prayer<br />
<br />
Well oh, let it rain<br />
For any dime just come and see my face<br />
Any time you just got to read my lines<br />
I won't give you any respect<br />
Oh, no<br />
<br />
<br>
Take a look at me baby<br />
(Just take a look over here at me baby)<br />
I'm your teenage prayer<br />
(Take a look at me baby, I'm a teenage prayer)<br />
Come and take a look at me baby<br />
(Yes take a look over here baby)<br />
I'm your teenage prayer<br />
('Cause I'm your teenage prayer)<br />
<br />
When it's cloudy all the time<br />
All you gotta do is say you're mine<br />
I come runnin' anywhere<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
(Take a look at me baby)<br />
I'm your teenage prayer<br />
(Prayer, hair, where)<br />
<br />
Yes I'm your teenage prayer<br />
You might think I'm not<br />
Somebody might think I'm nowhere<br />
But I'm here to tell you I'm your teenage prayer<br />
I know what you need<br />
I can feel it in my bones and I feel it on my throne<br />
You're my teenage prayer<br />
Any day any night<br />
You just come to me when you're in fright<br />
And I'm your teenage prayer<br />
<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
(Just take a look at me baby)<br />
I'm your teenage prayer<br />
(You know I'm your teenage prayer baby)<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
(Take a look at my hair baby)<br />
I'm your teenage prayer<br />
(I'm the teenage pair)<br />
<br />
When it's cloudy all the time<br />
All you gotta do is say you're mine<br />
'Cause I come runnin' to you anywhere<br />
Oh, yeah, oh you're so real<br />
Take a look at me baby<br />
I'm your teenage prayer</p>
