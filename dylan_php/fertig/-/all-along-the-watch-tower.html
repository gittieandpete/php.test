All Along the Watchtower<br />
<br />
There must be some kind of way outta here<br />
Said the joker to the thief<br />
There's too much confusion<br />
I can't get no relief<br />
Business men, they drink my wine<br />
Plowman dig my earth<br />
None were level on the mind<br />
Nobody up at his word<br />
Hey, hey<br />
No reason to get excited<br />
The thief he kindly spoke<br />
<br>
There are many here among us<br />
Who feel that life is but a joke<br />
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that<br />
And this is not our fate<br />
So let us stop talkin' falsely now<br />
The hour's getting late, hey<br />
All along the watchtower<br />
Princes kept the view<br />
While all the women came and went<br />
Barefoot servants, too<br />
Outside in the cold distance<br />
A wildcat did growl<br />
Two riders were approaching<br />
And the wind began to howl</p>
