People get ready, there's a train a-comin'<br />
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board<br />
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'<br />
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord<br />
<br />
People get ready for the train to Jordan<br />
Picking up passengers, coast to coast<br />
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em<br />
There's room for all among those loved the most<br />
<br>
<br />
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner<br />
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own<br />
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner<br />
Oh, there's no hidin' place against the kingdom's throne<br />
<br />
So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'<br />
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board<br />
All you need is faith, open the doors and board 'em<br />
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord</p>
