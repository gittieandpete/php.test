Ring them bells, ye heathen<br />
From the city that dreams<br />
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries<br />
Cross the valleys and streams<br />
For they're deep and they're wide<br />
And the world's on its side<br />
And time is running backwards<br />
And so is the bride<br />
<br />
Ring them bells St. Peter<br />
Where the four winds blow<br />
Ring them bells with an iron hand<br />
So the people will know<br />
Oh it's rush hour now<br />
On the wheel and the plow<br />
And the sun is going down<br />
Upon the sacred cow<br />
<br />
Ring them bells Sweet Martha<br />
For the poor man's son<br />
Ring them bells so the world will know<br />
<br>
That God is one<br />
Oh the shepherd is asleep<br />
Where the willows weep<br />
And the mountains are filled<br />
With lost sheep<br />
<br />
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf<br />
Ring them bells for all of us who are left<br />
Ring them bells for the chosen few<br />
Who will judge the many when the game is through<br />
Ring them bells, for the time that flies<br />
For the child that cries<br />
When innocence dies<br />
<br />
Ring them bells St. Catherine<br />
From the top of the room<br />
Ring them from the fortress<br />
For the lilies that bloom<br />
Oh the lines are long<br />
And the fighting is strong<br />
And they're breaking down the distance<br />
Between right and wrong</p>
