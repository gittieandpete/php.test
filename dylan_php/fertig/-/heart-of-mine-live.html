Heart of mine be still<br />
You can play with fire but you'll get the bill<br />
Don't let her know<br />
Don't let her know that you love her<br />
Don't be a fool, don't be blind<br />
Heart of mine<br />
<br />
Heart of mine go back home<br />
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam<br />
Don't let her see<br />
Don't let her see that you need her<br />
Don't put yourself over the line<br />
Heart of mine<br />
<br>
<br />
Heart of mine go back where you been<br />
It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in<br />
Don't let her hear<br />
Don't let her know where your'e going<br />
Don't untie the ties that bind<br />
Heart of mine<br />
<br />
Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile<br />
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile<br />
Don't let yourself fall Don't let yourself stumble<br />
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime<br />
Heart of mine</p>
