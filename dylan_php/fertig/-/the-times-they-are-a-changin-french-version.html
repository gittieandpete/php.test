[Couplet 1]<br />
Come gather around people<br />
Wherever you roam<br />
And admit that the waters<br />
Around you have grown<br />
And accept it that soon<br />
You'll be drenched to the bone<br />
If your time to you is worth saving<br />
Then you better start swimming<br />
Or you'll sink like a stone<br />
For the times they are a-changing<br />
<br />
[Couplet 2]<br />
Come writers and critics<br />
Who prophesize with your pen<br />
And keep your eyes wide<br />
The chance won't come again<br />
And don't speak too soon<br />
For the wheel's still in spin<br />
And there's no telling who that it's naming<br />
For the loser now will be later to win<br />
For the times they are a-changing<br />
<br />
[Couplet 3]<br />
Come senators, congressmen<br />
Please heed the call<br />
Don't stand in the doorway<br />
<br>
Don't block up the hall<br />
For he that gets hurt<br />
Will be he who has stalled<br />
There's a battle outside and it is raging<br />
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls<br />
For the times they are a-changing<br />
<br />
[Couplet 4]<br />
Come mothers and fathers<br />
Throughout the land<br />
And don't criticize<br />
What you can't understand<br />
Your sons and your daughters<br />
Are beyond your command<br />
Your old road is rapidly aging<br />
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand<br />
For the times they are a-changing<br />
<br />
[Couplet 5]<br />
The line it is drawn<br />
The curse it is cast<br />
The slow one now<br />
Will later be fast<br />
As the present now<br />
Will later be past<br />
The order is rapidly fading<br />
And the first one now will later be last<br />
For the times they are a-changing</p>
