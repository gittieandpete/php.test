There's guns across the river aimin' at ya<br />
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya<br />
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya<br />
Billy, they don't like you to be so free<br />
Campin' out all night on the berenda<br />
Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda<br />
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya<br />
Billy, don't you turn your back on me<br />
Playin' around with some sweet senorita<br />
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya<br />
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home<br />
There's eyes behind the mirrors in empty places<br />
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces<br />
There's always one more notch and ten more paces<br />
Billy, and you're walkin' all alone<br />
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number<br />
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber<br />
Every little sound just might be thunder<br />
Thunder from the barrel of his gun<br />
<br>
Guitars will play your grand finale<br />
Down in some Tularosa alley<br />
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home<br />
There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances<br />
Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances<br />
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances<br />
Advances on your spirit and your soul<br />
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down<br />
They've hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown<br />
Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down<br />
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?<br />
Hang on to your woman if you got one<br />
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one<br />
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one<br />
Billy, you been runnin' for so long<br />
Guitars will play your grand finale<br />
Down in some Tularosa alley<br />
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home</p>
