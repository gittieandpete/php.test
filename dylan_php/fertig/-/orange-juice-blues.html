I had a hard time waking this mornin'<br />
I got a lotta things on my mind<br />
Like those friends of yours, they keep bringing me down<br />
Just hangin' 'round all the time<br />
<br />
I've had a hard time waking most mornings<br />
And it's been that way for a month or more<br />
You've had things your way but now I've got to say<br />
I'm on my way out the door<br />
<br />
Why don't you get right?<br />
Try to get right, baby<br />
You haven't been right with me<br />
<br />
Why don't you get right?<br />
Try and get right, baby<br />
Don't you remember how it used to be?<br />
<br>
<br />
You had a hard time waking this mornin'<br />
And I can see it in your empty eyes<br />
But there's no need for talking or walking 'round the block<br />
Just to figure out the reason why<br />
<br />
I have a hard time handing out warnin'<br />
I'll just slide on out the door<br />
'Cause I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful<br />
And I ain't coming back no more<br />
<br />
Why can't you get right?<br />
Try to get right, baby<br />
You haven't been right with me<br />
<br />
Why don't you get right?<br />
Try and get right, baby<br />
Don't you remember how it used to be?</p>
