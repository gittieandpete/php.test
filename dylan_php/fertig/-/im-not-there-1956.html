Things are crashing down<br />
She's all too tight<br />
In my neighborhood<br />
She cried both day and night<br />
I know it because it was there<br />
<br />
It's a milestone<br />
But she's down on her luck<br />
And the day makes her lonely<br />
But to make it hard to buck, now and then<br />
<br />
I believe that she'd stop him<br />
If she would start to care<br />
I believe that she'd look upon<br />
His side that used to care<br />
And I'd go by the Lord<br />
Anywhere she's on my way<br />
But I don't belong there<br />
<br />
No I don't belong to her<br />
I don't belong to any body<br />
She's my Christ-forsaken angel<br />
But she don't hear me cry<br />
She's a lone-hearted mystic<br />
And she can't carry on<br />
When I'm there, she's all right<br />
But she's not when I'm gone<br />
<br />
Heaven knows that the answer<br />
She don't calling no one<br />
She's the way, forsaken beauty<br />
For she's mine, for the one<br />
And I lost her, hesitation<br />
By temptation as it runs<br />
But she don't holler me<br />
But I'm not there, I'm gone<br />
<br />
Now I'll cry tonight<br />
Like I cried the night before<br />
And I'm knees on the hassle<br />
But I'll dream about the door<br />
It's so long, she's forsaken<br />
By her faith, worse to tell<br />
It don't have contonation<br />
She smiles, fare thee well<br />
<br>
<br />
Now when I treat to leave 'er<br />
I was born to love her<br />
But she knows that the kingdom awaits<br />
So high above her<br />
And I run a better race<br />
But it's not too fast still<br />
But I don't perceive her<br />
I'm not there, I'm gone<br />
<br />
Well it's all about diffusion<br />
And I cry for her veil<br />
I don't need anybody now<br />
Beside me to tell<br />
And it's all affirmation<br />
I receive but it's not<br />
She's a lone-hearted beauty<br />
But she don't like a spot<br />
And she calls<br />
<br />
Yeah, she's gone like the rain<br />
Below the shining yesterday<br />
But now she's home beside me<br />
And I'd like her here to stay<br />
She's a lone, forsaken beauty<br />
And it don't trust anyone<br />
And I wish I was beside her<br />
But I'm not there, I'm gone<br />
<br />
Well, it's too hard to stay here<br />
And I don't want to leave<br />
It's so bad, for so few<br />
See, but she's a heart too hard to need<br />
It's alone, it's a crime<br />
The way she mauls me around<br />
But she don't fall to hate me<br />
But tears are gone, a painted clown<br />
<br />
Yes, I believe that it's rightful<br />
Oh, I believe it in my mind<br />
I've been told like I said one night before<br />
Carry on the cryin'<br />
And the sole gypsy told her<br />
Like I said, carry on<br />
I wish I was there to help her<br />
But I'm not there, I'm gone</p>
