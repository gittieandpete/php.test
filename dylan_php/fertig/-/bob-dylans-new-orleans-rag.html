I was sittin' on a stump down in New Orleans<br />
I was feelin' kinda low down, dirty an' mean<br />
Along come a fella and he didn't even ask<br />
He said, "I know of a woman who can fix you up fast."<br />
<br />
Well I didn't think twice, I just said like I should<br />
"Let's go find this lady who can do me some good."<br />
We walked across Rampart on a sailin' spree<br />
And we come to a door called one-oh-three<br />
<br />
I's just about ready to give my little knock<br />
When out comes a fella who couldn't even walk<br />
He's linkin' and a-slinkin', couldn't stand on his feet<br />
And he moaned and he groaned and he shuffled down the street<br />
<br />
Well, out of the door there comes another man<br />
He couldn't even talk and he couldn't even stand<br />
He moaned and he groaned and he shuffled his feet<br />
And he slid slidin' backwards down on Rampart street<br />
<br />
Well, I peeked thru the key hole and comin' down the hall<br />
Was a long legged man who could hardly crawl<br />
He had a terrible mean look in his eye<br />
Like he'd just fall to burn, he's was ready to die<br />
<br>
<br />
Well somebody else with his hell of a miss<br />
Fell out of the window and he fell the test<br />
Well he slid and he slunk in broken french<br />
And he looked like he'd been thru a monkey wrench<br />
<br />
Well, by this time I was a-scared to knock<br />
I was a-scared to move, I's in a state of shock<br />
I hummed a little tune and I shuffled my feet<br />
And I started walkin' backwards down Rampart street<br />
<br />
Well, I got to the corner I tried my best smile<br />
I turned around the corner and I ran a bloody mile<br />
Man, I wasn't around for to meet my wife<br />
I's just a-runnin' for to save my life<br />
<br />
Well, I's coughin' in my ears and wheezin' in my chest<br />
I musta run a mile in a minute or less<br />
I tripped on a log and I flumped on a stump<br />
I caught a fast freight train with a one-arm jump<br />
<br />
So if you're travellin' down Louisiana way<br />
And you're feelin' kinda lonesome and you need a place to stay<br />
Man, you're better off in your misery<br />
Than to tackle that lady in one-oh-three</p>
