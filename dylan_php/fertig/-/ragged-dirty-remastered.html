Lord I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too<br />
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too<br />
If I clean up sweet mama<br />
Can I stay all night with you?<br />
Lord, I went to my window, babe I couldn't see through my blinds<br />
Went to my window, babe I couldn't see through my blinds<br />
Heard my best friend coming around<br />
I thought I heard my baby cry<br />
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby then just let me sit down in your door<br />
If I can't come in here baby then just let me sit down in your door<br />
And I would leave so soon<br />
That your man won't never know<br />
<br>
How can I live here baby, Lord and feel at ease ?<br />
How can I live here baby, Lord and feel at ease ?<br />
Well, that woman I got, man<br />
She do just what she feels<br />
Lord you shouldn't mistreat me, baby because I'm young and wild<br />
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild<br />
You must always remember<br />
Baby, you was once a child<br />
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blind<br />
Leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blinds<br />
Well, I've been mistreated<br />
And I swear, I don't mind dyin'</p>
