You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last<br />
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast<br />
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun<br />
Crying like a fire in the sun<br />
Look out the saints are comin' through<br />
And it's all over now, Baby Blue<br />
<br />
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense<br />
Take what you have gathered from coincidence<br />
The empty-handed painter from your streets<br />
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets<br />
This sky, too, is folding under you<br />
And it's all over now, Baby Blue<br />
<br>
<br />
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home<br />
All your reindeer armies, are all going home<br />
The lover who just walked out your door<br />
Has taken all his blankets from the floor<br />
The carpet, too, is moving under you<br />
And it's all over now, Baby Blue<br />
<br />
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you<br />
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you<br />
The vagabond who's rapping at your door<br />
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore<br />
Strike another match, go start anew<br />
And it's all over now, Baby Blue</p>
