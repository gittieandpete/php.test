Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around<br />
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West<br />
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned<br />
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low<br />
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
High up on the housetops, high as I can see<br />
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white<br />
<br>
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"<br />
"All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"<br />
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup<br />
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?<br />
You loved all them rounders, never did love me<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone<br />
<br />
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?<br />
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me<br />
All the friends I ever had are gone</p>
