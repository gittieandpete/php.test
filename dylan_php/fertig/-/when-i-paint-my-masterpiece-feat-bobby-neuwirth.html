Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble<br />
Ancient footprints are everywhere<br />
You can almost think that you're seein' double<br />
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs<br />
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room<br />
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece<br />
She promised that she'd be right there with me<br />
When I paint my masterpiece<br />
<br />
Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum<br />
Dodging lions and wastin' time<br />
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em<br />
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb<br />
Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory<br />
<br>
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese<br />
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody<br />
When I paint my masterpiece<br />
<br />
Sailin' 'round the world in a dirty gondola<br />
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!<br />
<br />
I left Rome and landed in Brussels<br />
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried<br />
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles<br />
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside<br />
Newspapermen eating candy<br />
Had to be held down by big police<br />
Someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent<br />
When I paint my masterpiece</p>
