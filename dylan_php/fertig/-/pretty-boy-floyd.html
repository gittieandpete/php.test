If you'll gather 'round me, people<br />
A story I will tell<br />
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw<br />
Oklahoma knew him well<br />
<br />
It was in the town of Shawnee<br />
On a Saturday afternoon<br />
His wife beside him in a wagon<br />
As into town they rode<br />
<br />
There a deputy sheriff approached him<br />
In a manner rather rude<br />
Using vulgar words of language<br />
An' his wife she overheard<br />
<br />
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain<br />
And the deputy grabbed his gun<br />
In the fight that followed<br />
He laid that deputy down<br />
<br />
Now, he took to the hills and timber<br />
To live a life of shame<br />
Every crime in Oklahoma<br />
Was added to his name<br />
<br />
He took to the trees and timber<br />
On the Canadian river shore<br />
<br>
And pretty Boy found a welcome<br />
At every farmer's door<br />
<br />
Others tell you of a stranger<br />
That come to beg a meal<br />
And underneath the napkin<br />
Left a thousand dollar bill<br />
<br />
T'was in Oklahoma City<br />
It was on a Christmas Day<br />
There come a whole car load of groceries<br />
And a letter that did say:<br />
<br />
You say that I'm an outlaw<br />
You say that I'm a thief<br />
Well, here's a Christmas dinner<br />
For the families on relief<br />
<br />
Well, it's through this world I've rambled<br />
I've seen lots of funny men<br />
Some will rob you with a six-gun<br />
And some with a fountain pen<br />
<br />
Well, it's through this world you ramble<br />
It's through this world you roam<br />
You won't never see an outlaw<br />
Drive a family from their home</p>
