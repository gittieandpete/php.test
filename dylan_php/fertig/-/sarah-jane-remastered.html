I've got a wife and five little children<br />
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan<br />
With Sarah Jane<br />
Sarah Jane<br />
Ain't nothin' to do<br />
But to set down and sing<br />
And rock about my Sarah Jane<br />
<br />
Whistle done blows and the fiddler squalls<br />
Captain gone through the hole-in-the-wall<br />
Oh Sarah Jane<br />
Sarah Jane<br />
Ain't nothin' to do<br />
But to set down and sing<br />
And rock about my Sarah Jane<br />
<br />
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall<br />
Captain gone through the hole-in-the-wall<br />
Oh Sarah Jane<br />
<br>
Sarah Jane<br />
Ain't nothin' to do<br />
But to set down and sing<br />
And rock about my Sarah Jane<br />
<br />
Yankee built boats to shoot them Rebels<br />
My gun's steady gonna hold it level<br />
Sarah Jane<br />
Sarah Jane<br />
Ain't nothin' to do<br />
But to set down and sing<br />
And rock about my Sarah Jane<br />
<br />
I've got a wife and five little children<br />
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan<br />
Sarah Jane<br />
Sarah Jane<br />
Ain't nothin' to do<br />
But to set down and sing<br />
And rock about my Sarah Jane</p>
