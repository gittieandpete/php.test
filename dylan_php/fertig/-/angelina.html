[Verse 1]<br />
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances<br />
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances<br />
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances<br />
To the tune of a concertina<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Blood dryin' in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore<br />
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door<br />
But whatever it could be, makes me think you've seen me before<br />
Angelina<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud<br />
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd<br />
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed<br />
And the head of a hyena<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?<br />
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?<br />
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek<br />
Angelina<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode<br />
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed<br />
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road<br />
With your subpoena<br />
<br />
<br>
[Verse 6]<br />
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame<br />
I've tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game<br />
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same<br />
Angelina<br />
<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone<br />
Your servants are half dead, you're down to the bone<br />
Tell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrown<br />
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?<br />
<br />
[Verse 8]<br />
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old<br />
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold<br />
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing' a blindfold<br />
And so are you, Angelina<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
[Verse 9]<br />
I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force<br />
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse<br />
In God's truth tell me what you want and you'll have it of course<br />
Just step into the arena<br />
<br />
[Verse 10]<br />
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases<br />
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces<br />
Begging God for mercy and weeping' in unholy places<br />
Angelina<br />
<br />
[Chorus]</p>
