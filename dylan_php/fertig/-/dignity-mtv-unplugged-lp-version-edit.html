Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel<br />
Thin man lookin' at his last meal<br />
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield<br />
For dignity<br />
<br />
Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass<br />
Young man lookin' in the shadows that pass<br />
Poor man lookin' through painted glass<br />
For dignity<br />
<br />
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve<br />
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave<br />
I went into the city, went into the town<br />
Went into the land of the midnight sun<br />
<br />
Searchin' high, searchin' low<br />
Searchin' everywhere I know<br />
Askin' the cops wherever I go<br />
Have you seen dignity?<br />
<br />
Blind man breakin' out of a trance<br />
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance<br />
Hopin' to find one circumstance<br />
Of dignity<br />
<br />
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou<br />
She said "Don't want nobody see me talkin' to you"<br />
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew<br />
About dignity<br />
<br />
I went down where the vultures feed<br />
I would've got deeper, but there wasn't any need<br />
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men<br />
Wasn't any difference to me<br />
<br />
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade<br />
House on fire, debts unpaid<br />
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid<br />
Have you seen dignity?<br />
<br>
<br />
Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears<br />
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors<br />
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years<br />
For dignity<br />
<br />
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues<br />
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used<br />
He wanted money up front, said he was abused<br />
By dignity<br />
<br />
Footprints runnin' cross the sliver sand<br />
Steps goin' down into tattoo land<br />
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light<br />
In the border towns of despair<br />
<br />
Got no place to fade, got no coat<br />
I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat<br />
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote<br />
About dignity<br />
<br />
Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure<br />
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were<br />
And into every masterpiece of literature<br />
For dignity<br />
<br />
Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind<br />
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin<br />
Bites the bullet and he looks within<br />
For dignity<br />
<br />
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed<br />
Dignity never been photographed<br />
I went into the red, went into the black<br />
Into the valley of dry bone dreams<br />
<br />
So many roads, so much at stake<br />
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake<br />
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take<br />
To find dignity</p>
