Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed<br />
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams<br />
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed<br />
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams<br />
<br />
I and I<br />
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives<br />
I and I<br />
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives<br />
<br />
Think I'll go out and go for a walk<br />
Not much happenin' here, nothin' ever does<br />
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk<br />
I got nothin' to say, 'specially about whatever was<br />
<br />
I and I<br />
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives<br />
I and I<br />
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives<br />
<br />
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race<br />
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth<br />
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face<br />
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth<br />
<br>
<br />
I and I<br />
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives<br />
I and I<br />
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives<br />
<br />
Outside of two men on a train platform there's nobody in sight<br />
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track<br />
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's all right<br />
She should still be there sleepin' when I get back<br />
<br />
I and I<br />
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives<br />
I and I<br />
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives<br />
<br />
Noontime, and I'm still pushin' myself along the road, the darkest part<br />
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put<br />
Someone else is speakin' with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart<br />
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot<br />
<br />
I and I<br />
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives<br />
I and I<br />
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives</p>
