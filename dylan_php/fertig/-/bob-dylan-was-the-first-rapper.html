Minnesota, 1959<br />
Saw Buddy Holly 3 days before he died<br />
Looked him, straight in the eyes<br />
Right then and there he, made up his mind<br />
Moved out to N.Y.C<br />
Said he had a voice like you and me<br />

Bob Dylan was the, First Rapper<br />
Don't need no east coast, west coast kind of a disaster... but<br />
Bob Dylan was the First Rapper<br />
<br />
Johnny's in the basement<br />
Mixing up the medicine<br />
I'm on the pavement<br />
Thinkin' about the government<br />
The man in the trench coat<br />
Badge off, laid off, says he's got a bad cough<br />
Wants to get paid off<br />
Know for some, this is hard to handle<br />
All others enjoy the sample<br />

<br />
Get born, keep warm<br />
Short pants, romance<br />
Learn to dance, get dressed, get blessed<br />
Be a success, please her, please him<br />
Buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift<br />
Twenty years of schooling<br />
Put you on the day shift<br />
All respect to DJ Herc<br />
Did it in Jamaica, bought it to New York<br />
Grandmaster Flash, You stand tall<br />
But a form of it occurred, years before, before, before<br />
<br />
Bob Dylan was the first rapper<br />
First rapper<br />
Bob Dylan was the first rapper<br />
First rapper<br />
Bob Dylan was the first rapper<br />
This is just a whacked out song!!!</p>
