Hello darkness, my old friend<br />
I've come to talk with you again<br />
Because a vision softly creeping<br />
Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br />
And the vision that was planted in my brain<br />
Still remains<br />
Within the sound of silence<br />
In restless dreams I walk alone<br />
Narrow streets of cobblestone<br />
'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br />
I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br />
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br />
That split the night<br />
And touched the sound of silence<br />
And in the naked light I saw<br />
Ten thousand people, maybe more<br />
People talking without speaking<br />
<br>
People hearing without listening<br />
People writing songs that voices never share<br />
And no one dared<br />
Disturb the sound of silence<br />
"Fools" said I,"You do not know<br />
Silence like a cancer grows<br />
Hear my words that I might teach you<br />
Take my arms that I might reach you."<br />
But my words like silent raindrops fell<br />
And echoed<br />
In the wells of silence<br />
And the people bowed and prayed<br />
To the neon god they made<br />
And the sign flashed out its warning<br />
In the words that it was forming<br />
And the signs said, 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls<br />
And tenement halls<br />
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence</p>
