Lots of folks back east they say<br />
"Hello" every day<br />
Hitting the hard old dusty way to the California line<br />
Across that desert sand they go<br />
They're getting out of the old dust bowl<br />
They think they're going to a sugar bowl<br />
But here is what they find<br />
Oh the police at the port of entry say<br />
"You're number fourteen thousand for today"<br />
<br />
And, well if you ain't got the do re mi, boy<br />
If you ain't got the do re mi<br />
Better go on back to beautiful Texas<br />
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee<br />
California is the garden of eden<br />
A paradise to live in or see<br />
But believe it or not<br />
You won't find it so hot<br />
If you ain't got the do re mi<br />
<br>
<br />
If you want a house or farm<br />
That won't do nobody harm<br />
Take your vacation by the mountains or the sea<br />
Don't swap that old cow for a car<br />
Better stay right where you are<br />
You had better take this tip from me<br />
Cause I read it in the want ads every day<br />
And the headlines on the papers always say<br />
<br />
If you ain't got the do re mi, boy<br />
If you ain't got the do re mi<br />
Better go on back to beautiful Texas<br />
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee<br />
California is a garden of eden<br />
A paradise to live in or see<br />
But believe it or not<br />
You won't find it so hot<br />
If you ain't got the do re mi</p>
