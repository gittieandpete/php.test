Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair<br />
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair<br />
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue<br />
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue<br />
<br />
Oh I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay<br />
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway<br />
When I woke from my dreaming, my idols were clay<br />
All portion of love had all flown away<br />
<br>
<br />
Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love<br />
And to cherish me over all others above<br />
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell<br />
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell<br />
<br />
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower<br />
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour<br />
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour<br />
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower</p>
