Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
To get along with you<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
I'll do anything for you<br />
<br />
Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road with my head in my hand<br />
I'm lookin' for a woman needs a worried man<br />
Just-a one kind favor I ask you<br />
Allow me just one more chance<br />
<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
To ride your aeroplane<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
To ride your passenger train<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, I've been lookin' all over for a gal like you<br />
I can't find nobody, so you'll have to do<br />
There's just one kind favor I'll ask you<br />
Allow me just one more chance<br />
<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
To get along with you<br />
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br />
I'll do anything for you<br />
<br />
Well, lookin' for a woman that ain't got no man<br />
Is just lookin' for a needle that is lost in the sand<br />
Just one kind favor I ask you<br />
Allow me just one more chance</p>
