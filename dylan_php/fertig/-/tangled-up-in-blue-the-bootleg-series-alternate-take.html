[Verse 1]<br />
Early one morning the sun was shining<br />
He was laying in bed<br />
Wond'ring if she'd changed at all<br />
If her hair was still red<br />
Her folks they said their lives together<br />
Sure was gonna be rough<br />
They never did like Mama's homemade dress<br />
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough<br />
And he was standing at the side of the road<br />
Rain falling on his shoes<br />
Heading out for the old East Coast<br />
Lord knows he paid some dues, getting through<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
She was married when they first met<br />
Soon to be divorced<br />
He helped her out of a jam I guess<br />
But he used a little too much force<br />
And they drove that car as far as they could<br />
Abandoned it out west<br />
And split up on a dark sad night<br />
Both agreeing it was best<br />
And she turned around to look at him<br />
As he was walking away<br />
She said "This can't be the end<br />
We'll meet on another day, on the avenue<br />
Tangled up in blue."<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
He had a job in the great north woods<br />
Working as a cook for a spell<br />
But he never did like it all that much<br />
And one day the axe just fell<br />
So he drifted down to L.A<br />
Where he reckoned he tried his luck<br />
Working for a while in an airplane plant<br />
Loading cargo onto a truck<br />
But all the while he was alone<br />
The past was close behind<br />
He seen a lot of women<br />
But she never escaped his mind and he just grew<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
She was working in a topless place<br />
And I stopped in for a beer<br />
I just kept looking at the side of her face<br />
In a spotlight so clear<br />
And later on as the crowd thinned out<br />
I's about to do the same<br />
<br>
She was standing there, back of my chair<br />
Saying "Tell me, what's your name?"<br />
I muttered something underneath my breath<br />
She studied the lines of my face<br />
I must admit I felt a little uneasy<br />
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoes<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
She lit a burner on the stove<br />
And offered me a pipe<br />
"Thought you'd never say hello", she said<br />
"You look like the silent type"<br />
Then she opened up a book of poems<br />
And handed it to me<br />
Written by an Italian poet<br />
From the thirteenth century<br />
And every one of them words rang true<br />
And flowed like burning coal<br />
Pouring off of every page<br />
Like it was written in my soul from me to you<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
He was always in a hurry<br />
Too busy or too stoned<br />
And everything that she ever planned<br />
Just had to be postponed<br />
He thought they were successful<br />
She thought they were blessed<br />
With objects and material things<br />
But I never was impressed<br />
And when it all came crashing down<br />
I became withdrawn<br />
The only thing I knew how to do<br />
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
So now I'm going back again<br />
I got to get to her somehow<br />
All the people we used to know<br />
They're an illusion to me now<br />
Some are mathematicians<br />
Some are doctor's wives<br />
Don't know how it all got started<br />
Don't know what they're doing with their lives<br />
But me, I'm still on the road<br />
Heading for another joint<br />
We always did feel the same<br />
We just saw it from a different point of view<br />
Tangled up in blue</p>
