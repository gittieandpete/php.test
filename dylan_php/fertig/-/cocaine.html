Everytime my baby and me go up town<br />
Police come and they knock me down<br />
Cocaine, all around my brain<br />
<br />
Hey baby, better come here quick<br />
This old cocaine is making me sick<br />
Cocaine, all around my brain<br />
<br />
Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red<br />
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead<br />
Cocaine, all around my brain<br />
<br />
Hey baby, better come here quick<br />
This old cocaine is making me sick<br />
Cocaine, all around my brain<br />
<br>
<br />
Early one morning, half past four<br />
Cocaine came knockin' on my door<br />
Cocaine, all around my brain<br />
<br />
Hey baby, you better come here quick<br />
This old cocaine is making me sick<br />
Cocaine, all around my brain<br />
<br />
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men<br />
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when<br />
Cocaine, all around my brain<br />
<br />
Hey baby, you better come here quick<br />
This old cocaine is making me sick<br />
Cocaine, all around my brain</p>
