Unlike most of the songs nowadays that are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley<br />
That's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays<br />
This, this is a song, this wasn't written up there<br />
This was written somewhere down in the United States<br />
<br />
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were ridin' down the line<br />
Fixin' everybody's troubles, everybody's 'cept mine<br />
Someone must've told em that I was doin' fine<br />
<br />
Oh, you five and ten cent women there's nothin' in your heads<br />
I got a real gal I'm in love with, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead<br />
Go away from my door and my window too right now<br />
<br>
<br />
Lord, I ain't goin' down to no racetrack to see no sports car run<br />
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one<br />
I can walk anytime around the block<br />
<br />
Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me up and down the street<br />
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet<br />
Watch out so you don't step on me, on me<br />
<br />
Well, look it here, buddy, you want to be like me<br />
Pull your your six-shooter and rob every bank you see<br />
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah</p>
