She was the rose of sharon from paradise lost<br />
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.<br />
I was playing a show in miami in the theater of divine comedy.<br />
Told about jesus, told about the rain,<br />
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain<br />
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.<br />
<br />
Was she a child or a woman, i can't say which<br />
From one to another she could to easily switch<br />
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.<br />
Could i been used and played as a pawn?<br />
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on<br />
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.<br />
<br />
And them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico<br />
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire<br />
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,<br />
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.<br />
<br />
She looked into my soul through the clothes that i wore<br />
She said, &quot;we got a mutual friend over by the door,<br />
And you know he's got our best interest in mind.&quot;<br />
He was well connected but her heart was a snare<br />
And she had left him to die in there,<br />
There were payments due and he was a little behind.<br />
<br />
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,<br />
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,<br />
<br>
Street band playing &quot;nearer my god to thee.&quot;<br />
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,<br />
She said, &quot;i know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing<br />
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
And them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico<br />
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire<br />
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,<br />
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.<br />
<br />
Atlantic city by the cold grey sea<br />
I hear a voice crying, &quot;daddy,&quot; i always think it's for me,<br />
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.<br />
Every new messenger brings evil report<br />
'bout armies on the march and time that is short<br />
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.<br />
<br />
Would i have married her? i don't know, i suppose.<br />
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes<br />
But i kept hearing my name and i had to be movin' on.<br />
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,<br />
I saw a house in the country being torn from within.<br />
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.<br />
<br />
And them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico<br />
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire<br />
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,<br />
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.<br />
