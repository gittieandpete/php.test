I didn't mean<br />
To treat you so bad<br />
You shouldn't take it so personal<br />
I didn't mean<br />
To make you so sad<br />
You just happened to be there, that's all<br />
When I saw you say "goodbye" to your friend and smile<br />
I thought that it was well understood<br />
That you'd be comin' back in a little while<br />
I didn't know that you were sayin' "goodbye" for good<br />
<br />
But, sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
That you just did what you're supposed to do<br />
Sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
That I really did try to get close to you<br />
<br />
I couldn't see<br />
What you could show me<br />
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid<br />
I couldn't see<br />
How you could know me<br />
But you said you knew me and I believed you did<br />
When you whispered in my ear<br />
<br>
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her<br />
I didn't realize just what I did hear<br />
I didn't realize how young you were<br />
<br />
But, sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
That you're just doin' what you're supposed to do<br />
Sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
That I really did try to get close to you<br />
<br />
I couldn't see<br />
When it started snowin'<br />
Your voice was all that I heard<br />
I couldn't see<br />
Where we were goin'<br />
But you said you knew an' I took your word<br />
And then you told me later, as I apologized<br />
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm<br />
An' I told you, as you clawed out my eyes that I<br />
Never really meant to do you any harm<br />
<br />
But, sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
That you just did what you're supposed to do<br />
Sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
That I really did try to get close to you</p>
