[Hook: DNJ Breeze]<br />
I'm on that depression shit, You don't know how I'm living<br />
Go grab that knife boy, from out the kitchen<br />
I get to stabbing boy, I get to Cripping<br />
Get that poison and I get to sipping<br />
Grab that rope and now it's hang time<br />
Or grab that knife and blow my brains out<br />
If you care you better tell me now<br />
Cause I'm on that depression shit and I ain't fucking 'round<br />
<br />
[Verse 2: King Cedro]<br />
Dear lord I think I have depression<br />
My gift is a curse in the form of a blessing<br />
My niggas are dying, my momma is stressing<br />
Yet I keep it all like a secret left seperate<br />
Dear lord can you please save my soul<br />
My heart is as black as the winter is cold<br />
I am who I'm not, what I'm constantly told<br />
<br>
Now I'm rapping my life with deppresion like flows<br />
All of these niggas hate me<br />
But can these niggas hate me more than I hate myself<br />
Went from the nigga I was to the nigga I am<br />
I'm just a broken shell of my self<br />
I spend all my time on these women<br />
They play me like systems, a game and I think I need help<br />
I'm stuck in this prison known as Forest City<br />
Where niggas like me they be fleeing from death<br />
All these niggas, they thinking they gang<br />
And they all want to hit a stain or lick off of me<br />
These niggas so GD and BD and Moe and they blood<br />
I'm just trying to keep the peace<br />
I'm so 10-4L insane, Eastside<br />
I'm saying if war was to start it'd be cause of me<br />
If ops pull up, should I aim for head or let these niggas kill me?<br />
<br />
