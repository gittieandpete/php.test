[Verse 1: Marshall & Sarah]<br />
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?<br />
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?<br />
I stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains<br />
I walked and I crawled on six crooked highways<br />
I stepped in the middle of seven sad forests<br />
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans<br />
Been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard<br />
<br />
[Chorus:Marshall & Sarah]<br />
And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard<br />
Said a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
Said a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
<br />
[Verse 2: Sarah & Marshall]<br />
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?<br />
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?<br />
Saw a newborn baby with wild wolves around it<br />
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it<br />
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'<br />
<br>
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'<br />
I saw a white ladder all covered with water<br />
I saw ten thousand takers whose tongues were all broken<br />
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children<br />
<br />
[Chorus:Marshall & Sarah]<br />
And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard<br />
Said a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
Said a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
<br />
[Bridge: Marshall & Sarah]<br />
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br />
And what did you hear, my darling young one?<br />
<br />
[Chorus:Marshall & Sarah]<br />
And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard<br />
Said a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
Said a hard rain<br />
<br />
[Outro: Marshall]<br />
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?</p>
