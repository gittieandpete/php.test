Now, deep in the heart of a lonely kid<br />
Who suffered so much for what he did<br />
Gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame<br />
Since that day he ain't been the same<br />
See, the man with the stage fright<br />
Just standin' up there to give it all his might<br />
He got caught in the spotlight<br />
But when we get to the end<br />
He wants to start all over again<br />
I've got fire water right on my breath<br />
The doctor warned me I might catch a death<br />
Said, "You can make it in your disguise<br />
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes"<br />
See, the man with the stage fright<br />
Just standin' up there to give it all his might<br />
He got caught in the spotlight<br />
But when we get to the end<br />
<br>
He wants to start all over again<br />
Now, when he says that he's afraid<br />
Won't you take the man his word<br />
And for the price that the poor boy has paid<br />
He gets to sing just like a bird<br />
My brow is sweatin' and the mouth gets dry<br />
Fancy people go driftin' by<br />
The moment of truth is right at hand<br />
Just one more nightmare you could stand<br />
See the man with the stage fright<br />
Just standin' up there to give it all his might<br />
And he got caught in the spotlight<br />
But when we get to the end<br />
He wants to start all over again<br />
No, no, no please don't make him stop<br />
Yeah, let him take it from the top<br />
Oh, let him start all over again, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
