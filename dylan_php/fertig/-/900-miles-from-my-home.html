Well I'm down here on this track<br />
Not a shirt upon my back<br />
I will sail to you this sailing that I own<br />
Yes, I'll feed the ?? I took<br />
But ??<br />
Lord, I'm nine hundred miles from my home<br />
<br />
If my own lady she says so<br />
I'll railroad no more<br />
Sidetrack this engine ?? to roam<br />
Yes, I'm giving it my coal<br />
I'll gladly giving it all<br />
Cause I'm nine hundred miles from my home<br />
<br>
<br />
If I get down by the ??<br />
And the river still does run<br />
Yes, and everything I see turns to foam<br />
Even down on the ocean side<br />
Cause he don't wait just to pay my bribe<br />
Cause I'm nine hundred miles from my home<br />
<br />
Oh, Mary don't you moan<br />
Don't you weep all about<br />
Oh, Mary don't you weep and don't you moan<br />
If I get myself in line<br />
I will be there in due time<br />
Cause I'm nine hundred miles from my home</p>
