Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears<br />
While we all sup sorrow with the poor<br />
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears<br />
Oh, hard times, come again no more<br />
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary<br />
Hard times, hard times, come again no more<br />
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door<br />
Oh, hard times, come again no more<br />
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay<br />
There are frail forms fainting at the door<br />
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say<br />
Oh, hard times, come again no more<br />
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary<br />
Hard times, hard times, come again no more<br />
<br>
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door<br />
Oh, hard times, come again no more<br />
There's pale drooping maiden who toils her life away<br />
With a worn out heart, whose better days are over<br />
Though her voice it would be merry, 't is sighing all the day<br />
Oh, hard times, come again no more<br />
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary<br />
Hard times, hard times, come again no more<br />
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door<br />
Oh, hard times, come again no more<br />
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary<br />
Hard times, hard times, come again no more<br />
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door<br />
Oh, hard times, come again no more</p>
