The light in this place is really bad<br />
Like bein' in the bottom of a stream<br />
Any minute now<br />
I'm expecting to wake up from a dream<br />
<br />
Means so much the softest touch<br />
By the grave of some child<br />
Who neither wept nor smiled<br />
I've pondered my faith in the rain<br />
<br />
I been dreamin' of you that's all I do<br />
And it's drivin' me insane<br />
<br />
Somewhere dawn is breakin'<br />
Light is streakin' 'cross the floor<br />
Church bells are ringin'<br />
I wonder who they're ringin' for<br />
<br />
Travel under any star<br />
You'll see me wherever you are<br />
The shadowy past is so vague and so vast<br />
I'm sleepin' in the balance of pain<br />
<br />
I been dreamin' of you that's all I do<br />
But it's drivin' me insane<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll get me, maybe they won't<br />
But whatever it won't be tonight<br />
I wish your hand was in mine right now<br />
We could go where the moon is white<br />
<br />
For years they had me locked in a cage<br />
<br>
Then they threw me onto the stage<br />
Some things just last longer then you thought they would<br />
And they're never ever explained<br />
<br />
I'm dreamin' of you that's all I do<br />
And it's driving me insane<br />
<br />
Well I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry<br />
Live my life on the square<br />
Even if the flesh falls off my face<br />
It won't matter, long as you're there<br />
<br />
Feel like a ghost in love<br />
Underneath the heavens above<br />
Feel further away then I ever did before<br />
Feel further than I can take<br />
<br />
Dreamin' of you, that's all I do<br />
But it's driving me insane<br />
<br />
Everything in the way is so shiny today<br />
A queer and unusual form<br />
Spirals of golden haze here and there in a blaze<br />
Like beams of light in a storm<br />
<br />
Maybe you're here or maybe you weren't<br />
Maybe you touched somebody and got burned<br />
The silent sun has got me on the run<br />
Burnin' a hole in my brain<br />
<br />
I'm dreamin' of you that's all I do<br />
But it's driving me insane</p>
