Paroles de la chanson Backwater Blues :<br />
It rained five days<br />
The sky has turned black as night<br />
Oh, it rained five days<br />
And the sky has turned black as night<br />
And there's trouble takin' place<br />
Way down in the lowlands tonight<br />
<br />
I woke up this mornin'<br />
And I couldn't get out of my front door<br />
I woke up this mornin'<br />
And I couldn't get out of my front door<br />
It was so much trouble<br />
Make a poor man wonder where he wanna go<br />
<br />
They rowed a little boat<br />
About five miles 'cross the pond<br />
They rowed a little boat<br />
About five miles 'cross the pond<br />
I packed up all of my things and threw 'em in<br />
<br>
Boys and the boat rowed along<br />
<br />
I climbed up on the high lonely hill<br />
Oh, I climbed up on the high oh, lonely hill<br />
And I looked down at the house<br />
Baby, where I used to live<br />
<br />
Backwater blues caused me<br />
To pack my things and go<br />
The backwater blues caused me<br />
To pack my things and go<br />
'Cause my house fell down<br />
And I can't live there no more<br />
<br />
Yeah, when it's thunderin' and lightnin'<br />
And the rain begin to pour<br />
When it's thunderin' and lightnin'<br />
And the wind begin to blow<br />
There are so many poor people<br />
That didn't have no place to go</p>
