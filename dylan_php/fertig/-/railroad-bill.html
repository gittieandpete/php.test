Railroad Bill, Railroad Bill<br />
He never worked, and he never will<br />
And it's ride, ride, ride<br />
<br />
Railroad Bill he was a mighty mean man<br />
He shot the midnight lantern out of the brakeman's hand<br />
And it's ride, ride, ride<br />
<br />
Railroad Bill you know he took my wife<br />
Said if I didn't like it, he would take my life<br />
I'm gonna ride, ride, ride<br />
<br />
Goin' up the mountain, goin' out west<br />
<br>
.38 Spec a-stickin' out of my vest<br />
I'm gonna ride, ride, ride<br />
<br />
Buy me a pistol just as long as my arm<br />
And shoot anybody who does me any harm<br />
I'm gonna ride, ride, ride<br />
<br />
Railroad Bill, Railroad Bill<br />
He never worked, and he never will<br />
Ride, ride, ride<br />
<br />
Honey honey, honey think that I'm a fool<br />
Think I would quit you when the weather is cool<br />
Ride, ride, ride</p>
