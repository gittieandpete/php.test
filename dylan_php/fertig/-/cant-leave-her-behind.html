Where she leads me I do not know<br />
Well, she leads me where she goes<br />
I can't find her nowhere<br />
Well, she needs me here<br />
All aware I can't hear her walk<br />
I just cannot hear her talk<br />
<br>
Though sometimes, you know you will<br />
And when she comes my way<br />
I'll just be left any night or day<br />
I will hear her say<br />
That I don't wanna try<br />
I tried, also cried<br />
But I can't leave her behind</p>
