..and I'm a fool<br />
Each star's a pool of water, cool clear water<br />
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn<br />
And carry on to water<br />
Cool, clear water<br />
<br />
The shadows sway and seem to say<br />
“Tonight we pray for water<br />
Cool, clear water.”<br />
And way up there He'll hear our prayer<br />
And show us where there's water<br />
Cool, clear water<br />
<br />
<br>
Keep a-movin', Dan, don't you listen to him, Dan<br />
He's a devil not a man<br />
And he spreads the burning sand with water<br />
Dan, can you see that big green tree<br />
Where the water's running free<br />
And it's waiting there for you and me<br />
Cool, clear water<br />
<br />
Dan's feet are sore, he's yearning for<br />
Just one thing more than water<br />
Cool, clear water<br />
Like me, I guess, he'd like to rest<br />
Where there's no quest for water<br />
Cool, clear water</p>
