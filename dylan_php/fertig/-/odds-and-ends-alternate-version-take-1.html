I stand it all and I shake my face<br />
You break your promise all over the place<br />
You promised to love me but what do I see?<br />
Just you comin' and spillin' juice over me<br />
Odds and ends, odds and ends<br />
Lost time is not found again<br />
Now, you take your file and you bend my head<br />
I never can remember anything that you've said<br />
You promised to love me but what do I know?<br />
<br>
You're always spillin' juice on me like you got someplace to go<br />
Odds and ends, odds and ends<br />
Lost time is not found again<br />
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean<br />
You know what I'm sayin' and you know what I mean<br />
From now on you'd best get on someone else<br />
While you're doin' it, keep that juice to yourself<br />
Odds and ends, odds and ends<br />
Lost time is not found again</p>
