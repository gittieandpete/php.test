I buyed me a little dog, color it was brown<br />
I learned him to whistle, sing and dance and run<br />
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears they were quite broad<br />
Around the world in half a day and on him I could ride<br />
Sing taddle o day<br />
<br />
I buyed me a little bull about four inches high<br />
Everybody feared him that ever heard him cry<br />
When he begins to bellow it made such melodious sound<br />
Till all the walls in London came tumbling to the ground<br />
Sing taddle o day<br />
<br />
I buyed me a flock of sheep, I thought they were all wethers<br />
Sometimes they yielded wool, sometimes they yielded feathers<br />
<br>
I think mine are the very best sheep for yielding me increase<br />
For every full and change of the moon they bring both lambs and geese<br />
Sing taddle o day<br />
<br />
I buyed me a little box about four acres square<br />
I filled it full of guineas and silver so fair<br />
Oh now I'm bound for Turkey, I'll travel like an ox<br />
In my breeches pocket, I'll carry my little box<br />
Sing taddle o day<br />
<br />
I buyed me a little hen, all speckled gay and fair<br />
I sat her on an oyster shell, she hatched me out a hare<br />
The hare it sprang a handsome horse full fifteen hands high<br />
And him that tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie<br />
Sing taddle o day</p>
