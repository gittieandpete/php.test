Well i'm sittin' in church in an old wooden chair<br />
I knew nobody would look for me there<br />
Sorrow and pity rule the earth and the skies<br />
Looking for nothin' in anyone's eyes<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty gal, did me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Snow flakes are fallin' around my head<br />
Lord have mercy, it feel heavy like lead<br />
I been hit too hard, seen too much<br />
Nothing can heal me now but your touch<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty gal, she did me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Loneliness got a mind of its own<br />
The more people around, the more you feel alone<br />
I'm chained to the earth like a silent slave<br />
Trying to break free out of death's dark cave<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty gal, done me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Boys in the street beginnin' to play<br />
Girls like birds flyin' away<br />
I'm carryin' the roses that were given to me<br />
<br>
And I'm thinkin' about paradise wonderin' where it might be<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty gal, she done me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Go over to London, maybe gay Paris<br />
Follow the river you get to the sea<br />
I was hopin' we could drink from life's clear streams<br />
I was hopin' we could dream life's pleasant dreams<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty gal, but she done me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Well the weak get weaker and the strong stay strong<br />
The train keeps rollin' all night long<br />
She looked at me with an irresistable glance<br />
With a smile that could make all the planets dance<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty gal, she did me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
<br />
My house is on fire, burnin' to the skies<br />
I thought the rain clouds, but the clouds passed by<br />
When I'm gone you'll remember my name<br />
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty gal, but she did me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long</p>
