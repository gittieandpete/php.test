Crimson flames tied through my ears<br />
Rollin' high and mighty traps<br />
Pounced with fire on flaming roads<br />
Using ideas as my maps<br />
<br />
"We'll meet on edges soon" said I<br />
Proud 'neath heated brow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then<br />
I'm younger than that now<br />
<br />
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth<br />
"Rip down all hate" I screamed<br />
Lies that life is black and white<br />
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed<br />
<br />
Romantic facts of musketeers<br />
Foundationed deep somehow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then<br />
I'm younger than that now<br />
<br />
Girl's faces formed the forward path<br />
From phony jealousy<br />
To memorizing politics<br />
Of ancient history<br />
<br />
Flung down by corpse evangelists<br />
Unthought of, though, somehow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then<br />
I'm younger than that now<br />
<br>
<br />
A self-ordained professor's tongue<br />
Too serious to fool<br />
Spouted out that liberty<br />
Is just equality in school<br />
<br />
"Equality," I spoke the word<br />
As if a wedding vow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then<br />
I'm younger than that now<br />
<br />
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand<br />
At the mongrel dogs who teach<br />
Fearing not I'd become my enemy<br />
In the instant that I preach<br />
<br />
My existence led by confusion boats<br />
Mutiny from stern to bow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then<br />
I'm younger than that now<br />
<br />
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats<br />
Too noble to neglect<br />
Deceived me into thinking<br />
I had something to protect<br />
<br />
Good and bad, I define these terms<br />
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then<br />
I'm younger than that now</p>
