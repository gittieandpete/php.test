Four strong winds that blow lonely<br />
Seven seas that run high<br />
All these things that won't change<br />
Come what may<br />
But the good times all are gone<br />
And I'm bound for movin' on<br />
I'll look for you if you ever come this way<br />
<br />
Think I'll go down to Alberta<br />
Where there's good there in the fall<br />
I've got some friends that I can go workin' for<br />
But I wish you'd change your mind<br />
If I ask you one more time<br />
But we've been through that a hundred times or more<br />
<br />
Four strong winds that blow lonely<br />
Seven seas that run high<br />
<br>
All these things that don't change<br />
Come what may<br />
But the good times are all gone<br />
And I'm bound for movin' on<br />
I'll look for you if you ever come this way<br />
<br />
(A few lines are inaudible)<br />
But by then it would be springtime<br />
There ain't too much for you to do<br />
So I see you when I pass this way again<br />
<br />
Four strong winds that blow lonely<br />
Seven seas that run high<br />
All these things that won't change<br />
Come what may<br />
But the good times are all gone<br />
And I'm bound for movin' on<br />
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way</p>
