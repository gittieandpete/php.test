Come round you old time cowboys, and listen to my song<br />
Please do not grow weary, I will not detain you long<br />
Concerning some young cowboy, who did agree to go<br />
Spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo<br />
Well I found myself in Griffin, in the year of '83<br />
When a world-famous drover come a-walkin' up to me<br />
Sayin', "How d'ya do young cowboy. how'd you like to go<br />
Spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo?"<br />
Well me being out of work right then, at this drover I did say<br />
"This a-goin' out on the buffalo range depends upon your pay<br />
But if you pay good wages, transportation to and fro'<br />
Think I might go with you on the hunt of the buffalo."<br />
"yes I will pay good wages and transportation too<br />
If you'll agree to work for me until the season's through<br />
<br>
But if you do get homesick and try to run away<br />
You'll starve to death on the prairie and also lose your pay."<br />
Well with all this flatterin' talkin', he signed up quite a train<br />
Some ten to twelve in number, some able-bodied men<br />
Our trip it was a pleasant one as we hit the westward road<br />
Until we hit old Boggy Creek in old New Mexico<br />
Well there our pleasures ended and our troubles they begun<br />
A lightin' storm did hit us, made the cattle run<br />
I got all full of stickers from the cactus that did grow<br />
Outlaws watchin' to pick us off from the hills of the buffalo<br />
Well our workin' season ended, but the drover would not pay<br />
He said, "You went and drunk too much, you're all in debt to me."<br />
But the cowboys never did hear of such a thing as a bankrupt law<br />
So we left tht drover's bones to bleach on the hills of the buffalo</p>
