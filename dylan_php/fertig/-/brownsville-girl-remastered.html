Well, there was this movie I seen one time<br />
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck<br />
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself<br />
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck<br />
<br />
Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp<br />
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath<br />
Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square<br />
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death<br />
<br />
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in<br />
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain<br />
You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart<br />
The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train<br />
<br />
I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert<br />
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels<br />
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet<br />
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel<br />
<br />
Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton'<br />
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft<br />
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back<br />
I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off<br />
<br />
Well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies<br />
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul<br />
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times when I was your only man<br />
And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control<br />
<br />
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br />
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love<br />
<br />
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo<br />
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin' lot outside of town about a mile<br />
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust<br />
She said, "Henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."<br />
<br />
Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of bummin' a ride back to where she started<br />
But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up<br />
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead." You could tell she was so broken-hearted<br />
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."<br />
<br />
"How far are y'all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh<br />
"We're going all the way 'til the wheels fall off and burn<br />
'Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."<br />
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."<br />
<br />
<br>
Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my head<br />
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play<br />
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved<br />
And a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way<br />
<br />
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br />
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love<br />
<br />
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour<br />
I was crossin' the street when shots rang out<br />
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran<br />
"We got him cornered in the churchyard," I heard somebody shout<br />
<br />
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it, it said, "A man with no alibi."<br />
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you<br />
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears<br />
It was the best acting I saw anybody do<br />
<br />
Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line<br />
Oh if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now<br />
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much. I could feel a whole lot better<br />
If you were just here by my side to show me how<br />
<br />
Well, I'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck<br />
Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind<br />
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about<br />
But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line<br />
<br />
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br />
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love<br />
<br />
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned<br />
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn't Henry Porter<br />
And you know there was somethin' about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world<br />
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind in the French Quarter<br />
<br />
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content<br />
I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone<br />
You always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do what's most convenient, then they repent<br />
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."<br />
<br />
There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice<br />
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound<br />
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back<br />
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down<br />
<br />
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br />
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love</p>
