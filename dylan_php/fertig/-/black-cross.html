This is the story of Hezekiah Jones<br />
Hezekiah Jones lived in a place... in Arkansas<br />
He never had too much, except he had some land<br />
An' he had a couple of hogs and things like that<br />
He never had much money<br />
But he'd spend what he did make as fast as he made it<br />
So it never really mattered that he had much money<br />
But in a cupboard there, he kept in the cupboard...<br />
He kept in the cupboard books<br />
He called the books his "rainy season."<br />
The white folks around the county there talked about Hezekiah...<br />
They... said, "Well... old Hezekiah, he's harmless enough<br />
But the way I see it he better put down them goddam books<br />
Readin' ain't no good, for nigga is nigga."<br />
One day the white man's preacher came around<br />
Knockin' on doors, knockin' on all the doors in the county<br />
He knocked on Hezekiah's door<br />
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Lord?"<br />
<br>
Hezekiah says, "Well, I don't know, I never really SEEN the Lord<br />
I can't say, yes, I do..."<br />
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Church?"<br />
Hezekiah says, "Well, the Church is divided, ain't they<br />
And... they can't make up their minds<br />
I'm just like them, I can't make up mine either."<br />
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe that if a man is good Heaven is his last reward?"<br />
Hezekiah says, "I'm good... good as my neighbor."<br />
"You don't believe in nothin'," said the white man's preacher<br />
You don't believe in nothin'!"<br />
"Oh yes, I do," says Hezekiah<br />
"I believe that a man should be indebted to his neighbors<br />
Not for the reward of a Heaven or fear of hellfire."<br />
"But you don't understand," said the white man's preacher<br />
"There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked..."<br />
Then they hung Hezekiah high as a pigeon<br />
White folks around there said, "Well... he had it comin'<br />
'Cause the son-of-a-bitch never had no religion!"</p>
