As I walked out tonight in a mystic garden<br />
Wounded flowers were dangling from the vine<br />
I was passing by yon' cool and crystal fountain<br />
Someone hit me from behind<br />
Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
Through this weary world of woe<br />
Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
No one on earth will ever know<br />
They say prayer has the power to help so pray for the mother<br />
In the human heart, the evil spirit can dwell<br />
I'm trying to love my neighbor, do good unto others<br />
But mother, things ain't goin' well<br />
Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
I'll burn that bridge before you get across<br />
Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost<br />
I'm all worn out from weeping<br />
My eyes are full of tears and my lips are dry<br />
If I ever catch my opponent sleeping<br />
I'll slaughter him where they lie<br />
Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
Through a world mysterious and vague<br />
Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
Walkin' through the cities of the plague<br />
The whole world is full of speculation<br />
The whole world that people say is round<br />
I've got no time for idle conversation<br />
I need to find a doctor in this town<br />
<br>
Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
All rails leading to the west<br />
Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
I'm gonna throw myself upon your loving breast<br />
It's the first new day of a grand and glorious autumn<br />
The queen of love is coming across the grass<br />
None may call her anything but madam<br />
No one flirts with her nor even makes a pass<br />
Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
Standing outside the gates of wrath<br />
Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
Take a little trip down the primrose path<br />
Now I got the worst old feeling and it's getting stronger<br />
I'm going out with a couple of fellows, I'm beginning to crack<br />
I won't stay out any longer<br />
I'll avenge my father's death and I'll step back<br />
Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
Hand me down my walking cane<br />
Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
Trying to get you out of my miserable brain<br />
As I walk out tonight in the mystic garden<br />
The wounded flowers are dangling from the vine<br />
I was passing by yon' cool and crystal fountain<br />
Someone lit me from behind<br />
Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
You ride them high and down you go<br />
Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
No one on earth will ever know</p>
