I don't hurt anymore;<br />
All my teardrops are dry<br />
No more walking the floor<br />
With that burning inside<br />
<br />
Just to think it could be;<br />
Time has opened the door<br />
And at last I am free<br />
I don't hurt anymore<br />
<br />
Oh, you still deny<br />
I wanted to die<br />
The day taht you said we were through<br />
But now that I find<br />
You're out of my mind<br />
I can't believe that it's true<br />
<br>
<br />
I forgot it somehow<br />
That I cancelled before<br />
And it's wonderful now<br />
I don't hurt anymore<br />
<br />
No use to deny<br />
I wanted to die<br />
The day that you said we were through<br />
But now that I find<br />
You're out of my mind<br />
I can't believe that it's true<br />
<br />
I forgot it somehow<br />
That I cancelled before<br />
And it's wonderful now<br />
I don't hurt anymore</p>
