I am just a poor boy<br />
Though my story's seldom told<br />
I have squandered my resistance<br />
For a pocketful of mumbles<br />
Such are promises, all lies and jest<br />
Still a man hears what he wants to hear<br />
And disregards the rest<br />
<br />
When I left my home and family<br />
I was no more than a boy<br />
In the company of strangers<br />
In the quiet of the railway station<br />
Running scared, laying low<br />
Seeking out the poorer quarters<br />
Where the ragged people go<br />
Looking for the places only they would know<br />
<br />
Asking only workman's wages<br />
I come looking for a job<br />
But I get no offers<br />
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue<br />
I do declare<br />
There were times when I was so lonesome<br />
<br>
I took some comfort there<br />
<br />
Now the years go rushing by me<br />
They are rocking evenly<br />
I am older than I once was<br />
But I'm younger than I'll be, that's not unusual<br />
No it isn't strange<br />
After changes upon changes we are more, or less the same<br />
After changes we are more, or less the same<br />
<br />
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes<br />
And wishing I was gone, going home<br />
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me<br />
Leading me<br />
Going home<br />
<br />
In the clearing stands a boxer<br />
And a fighter by his trade<br />
And he carries the reminders<br />
Of every glove that laid him down<br />
And cut him till he cried out<br />
In his anger and his shame<br />
"I am leaving, I am leaving"<br />
But the fighter still remains</p>
