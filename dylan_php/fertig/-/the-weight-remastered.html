I pulled into Nazareth just a feelin' 'bout a half past dead<br />
I just need to find a place where I can lay my head<br />
Mister can you tell me where a man might find a bed?<br />
He just grinned and shook my hand and "No" was all he said<br />
Take a load off Fanny<br />
Take a load for free<br />
Take a load off Fanny<br />
And you put the load right on me<br />
I picked up my bag and went lookin' for a place to hide<br />
When I saw old Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side<br />
And I said, "Hey Carmen, come on will you go downtown?"<br />
She said, "Well I gotta go but my friend can stick around anyhow"<br />
Take a load off Fanny<br />
Take a load for free<br />
Take a load off Fanny<br />
And you put the load right on me<br />
Go down Miss Moses, ain't nothin' that you can say<br />
'Cause is just old Luke and Luke's waitin' on the judgment day<br />
Well now Luke my friend, what about young Anna Lee?<br />
He said, "Do me a favor son<br />
<br>
Won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?"<br />
Take a load off Fanny<br />
Take a load for free<br />
Take a load off Fanny<br />
And you put the load right on me<br />
Crazy Chester followed me yeah, and he caught me in the fog<br />
He said, "I would fix your rack, oh yeah if you'll just take Jack, my dog"<br />
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I am a peaceful man"<br />
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"<br />
Won't ya take a load off Fanny?<br />
Take a load for free<br />
Take a load off Fanny<br />
And you put the load right on me<br />
Catch a cannon ball now, to take me down the line<br />
'Cause my bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time<br />
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one<br />
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone<br />
I want you to take a load off Fanny<br />
Take a load for free<br />
Take a load off Fanny<br />
And you put the load right on me</p>
