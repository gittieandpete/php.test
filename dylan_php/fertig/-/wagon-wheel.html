Headed down south to the land of the pines<br />
And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline<br />
Starin' up the road<br />
And pray to God I see headlights<br />
<br />
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours<br />
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers<br />
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh<br />
I can see my baby tonight<br />
<br />
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel<br />
Rock me mama anyway you feel<br />
Hey mama rock me<br />
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain<br />
Rock me mama like a south-bound train<br />
Hey mama rock me<br />
<br />
Runnin' from the cold up in New England<br />
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time stringband<br />
My baby plays the guitar<br />
I pick a banjo now<br />
<br />
Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now<br />
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave<br />
But I ain't a turnin' back<br />
To livin' that old life no more<br />
<br>
<br />
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel<br />
Rock me mama anyway you feel<br />
Hey mama rock me<br />
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain<br />
Rock me mama like a south-bound train<br />
Hey mama rock me<br />
<br />
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke<br />
I caught a trucker out of Philly<br />
Had a nice long toke<br />
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap<br />
To Johnson City, Tennessee<br />
<br />
And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun<br />
I hear my baby callin' my name<br />
And I know that she's the only one<br />
And if I die in Raleigh<br />
At least I will die free<br />
<br />
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel<br />
Rock me mama anyway you feel<br />
Hey mama rock me<br />
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain<br />
Rock me mama like a south-bound train<br />
Hey mama rock me</p>
