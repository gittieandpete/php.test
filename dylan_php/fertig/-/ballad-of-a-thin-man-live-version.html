You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand<br />
You see somebody naked and you say, "Who is that man?"<br />
You try so hard but you don't understand<br />
Just what you will say when you get home<br />
Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mr. Jones?<br />
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"<br />
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his"<br />
And you say, "What's mine?" and somebody else says, "Well, what is?"<br />
And you say, "Oh my God, am I here all alone?"<br />
But something is happening and you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mr. Jones?<br />
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek<br />
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak<br />
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"<br />
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone<br />
And something is happening here but you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mr. Jones?<br />
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks<br />
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination<br />
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you to all give a check<br />
To tax-deductible charity organizations<br />
Ah, you've been with the professors and they've all liked your looks<br />
<br>
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks<br />
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books<br />
You're very well-read, it's well-known<br />
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mr. Jones?<br />
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels<br />
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels<br />
And without further notice, he asks you how it feels<br />
And he says, "Here is your throat back, thanks for the loan"<br />
And you know something is happening but you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mr. Jones?<br />
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now"<br />
And you say, "For what reason?" and he says, "How"<br />
And you say, "What does this mean?" and he screams back, "You're a cow!<br />
Give me some milk or else go home"<br />
And you know something's happening but you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mr. Jones?<br />
Well, you walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown<br />
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground<br />
There ought to be a law against you comin' around<br />
You should be made to wear earphones<br />
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, Mr. Jones?</p>
