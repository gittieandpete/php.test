Paroles de la chanson 1913 Massacre :<br />
Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen<br />
To Calumet, Michigan in the copper country<br />
I'll take you to a place called Italian Hall<br />
And the miners are having their big Christmas ball<br />
<br />
I'll take you in a door and up a high stairs<br />
Singing and dancing is heard ev'rywhere<br />
I'll let you shake hands with the people you see<br />
And watch the kids dance 'round the big Christmas tree<br />
<br />
There's talking and laughing and songs in the air<br />
And the spirit of Christmas is there ev'rywhere<br />
Before you know it you're friends with us all<br />
And you're dancing around and around in the hall<br />
<br />
You ask about work and you ask about pay<br />
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day<br />
Working their copper claims, risking their lives<br />
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives<br />
<br />
A little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights<br />
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet<br />
To hear all this fun; you would not realize<br />
That the copper boss thug men are milling outside<br />
<br />
<br>
The copper boss thugs stuck their heads in the door<br />
<br />
One of them yelled and he screamed, "There's a fire"<br />
A lady she hollered, "There's no such a thing;<br />
Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing."<br />
<br />
A few people rushed and there's only a few<br />
"It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you."<br />
A man grabbed his daughter and he carried her down<br />
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out<br />
<br />
And then others followed, about a hundred or more<br />
But most everybody remained on the floor<br />
The gun thugs, they laughed at their murderous joke<br />
And the children were smothered on the stairs by the<br />
Door<br />
<br />
Such a terrible sight I never did see<br />
We carried our children back up to their tree<br />
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree<br />
And the children that died there was seventy-three<br />
<br />
The piano played a slow funeral tune<br />
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon<br />
The parents, they cried and the men, they moaned<br />
"See what your greed for money has done?"</p>
