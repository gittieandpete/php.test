The love that faded left me only tears<br />
Days that were happy turned into lonely years<br />
Vows that we made turned into lies<br />
My life is empty, my lonely heart cries<br />
<br />
I tried to forget that we'll never be<br />
Nothing left for me but dust in the breeze<br />
My way is lonely but I think I'm lost<br />
My love was wasted, I'm paying the cost<br />
<br>
<br />
Brown eyes, blue eyes they're all the same<br />
None are for me, I've lost their game<br />
Tomorrow has nothing but worries and cares<br />
The love that faded left me only tears<br />
<br />
Just like the rose your love faded away<br />
Now my lonely heart must break and pay<br />
Nothing now but heartaches through years<br />
The love that faded left me only tears</p>
