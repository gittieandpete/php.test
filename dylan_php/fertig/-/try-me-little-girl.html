Try me<br />
Try me, little girl<br />
We could raise a family<br />
<br />
Well they treat you like a dummy<br />
Well they treat you like a slave<br />
Nothin' bout what you said, it's all<br />
What you gave<br />
Try me<br />
Try me<br />
Try me, little girl<br />
<br>
We could raise a family<br />
<br />
Well, they treat so low<br />
At the time I'll ring out of way<br />
Oh, nika tho nika, three's gotta you gonna way<br />
Oh, well it's three in the morning<br />
I get no room<br />
Based on cell she is sittin' on room<br />
Try me<br />
Try me<br />
Try me, little girl<br />
We gonna raise a family</p>
