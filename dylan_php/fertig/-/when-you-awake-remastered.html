Ollie told me I'm a fool. So I<br />
Walked on down the road a mile, Went to the house that brings a smile<br />
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, And what do you think he said to me?<br />
When You Awake you will remember ev'rything, You will be<br />
Hangin' on a string from your When you believe, You will relieve the only<br />
Soul<br />
That you were born with to grow old and never know<br />
Ollie showed me the fork in the road<br />
You can take to the left or go straight to the right<br />
Use your days and save your nights<br />
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat<br />
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat<br />
When You Awake you will remember ev'rything, You will be<br />
Hangin' on a string from your When you believe, You will relieve the only<br />
Soul<br />
That you were born with to grow old and never know<br />
Ollie showed me the fork in the road<br />
<br>
Ollie warned me it's a mean old world<br />
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true<br />
But what am I supposed to do<br />
Read the writing on the wall<br />
I heard itwhen I was very small<br />
When You Awake you will remember ev'rything, You will be<br />
Hangin' on a string from your When you believe, You will relieve the only<br />
Soul<br />
That you were born with to grow old and never know<br />
Ollie showed me the fork in the road<br />
Wash my hand in lye water, I got a date with the<br />
Captains daughter. You can go and tell your brother. We sure gonna<br />
Love one another, Oh! You<br />
May be right and ya might be wrong, I ain't gonna worry all day long<br />
Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, My old car froze<br />
Up last night. Ain't no reason to hang your head I could wake up in the<br />
Mornin' dead. Oh! And<br />
If I thought it would do any good, I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood</p>
