Well, I wandered alone through a desert of stone<br />
And I dreamt of my future wife<br />
My sword's in my hand and I'm next in command<br />
In this version of death called life<br />
<br />
My plate and my cup are right straight up<br />
I took a rose from the hand of a child<br />
When I kiss your lips, the honey drips<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
<br />
Everyday we meet on any old street<br />
And you're in your girlish prime<br />
The short and the tall are coming to the ball<br />
I go there all the time<br />
<br />
Behind every tree, there's something to see<br />
The river is wider than a mile<br />
I tried you twice, you can't be nice<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
<br />
Here come the nurse with money in her purse<br />
Here come the ladies and men<br />
You push it all in and you've no chance to win<br />
You play 'em on down to the end<br />
<br />
I'm laying in the sand, getting a sunshine tan<br />
<br>
Moving along, riding in style<br />
From my toes to my head you knock me dead<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
<br />
I count the years and I shed no tears<br />
I'm blinded to what might have been<br />
Nature's voice makes my heart rejoice<br />
Play me the wild song of the wind<br />
<br />
I found hopeless love in the room above<br />
When the sun and the weather were mild<br />
You're as fine as wine, I ain't handing you no line<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
<br />
All the merry little elves can go hang themselves<br />
My faith is as cold as can be<br />
I'm stacked high to the roof and I'm not without proof<br />
If you don't believe me, come see<br />
<br />
You think I'm blue, I think so too<br />
In my words you'll find no guile<br />
The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold<br />
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
<br />
The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while</p>
