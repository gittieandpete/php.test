One evening for pleasure I rambled to view<br />
The fair fields all alone<br />
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron<br />
Where beauty and pleasure were known<br />
<br />
I spied a fair maid at her labour<br />
Which caused me to stay for a while<br />
And I thought of a goddess to beauty<br />
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle<br />
<br />
I humbled myself to her beauty<br />
"Fair maiden, where do you belong?<br />
Are you from heaven descended<br />
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"<br />
<br />
"Young man, I will tell you a secret<br />
It's true I'm a maid that is poor<br />
<br>
And to part from my vows and my promise<br />
Is more than my heart can endure<br />
<br />
Therefore I remain at my service<br />
And go through all my hardship and toil<br />
And wait for the lad that has left me<br />
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"<br />
<br />
"Young maiden I wish not to banter<br />
It's true I come here in disguise<br />
I came here to fulfil our last promise<br />
And hope to give you a surprise<br />
<br />
I've known you're a maid I love dearly<br />
And you've been in my heart all the while<br />
For me there is no other damsel<br />
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"</p>
