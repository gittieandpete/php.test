Love rescue me<br />
Come forth and speak to me<br />
Raise me up<br />
And don't let me fall<br />
No man is my enemy<br />
My own hands imprison me<br />
Love rescue me<br />
<br />
Many strangers have I met<br />
On the road to my regret<br />
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me<br />
They ask me to reveal<br />
The very thoughts they would conceal<br />
Love, rescue me<br />
<br />
And the sun in the sky<br />
Makes a shadow of you and I<br />
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea<br />
I'm here without a name<br />
In the palace of my shame<br />
I said, love, rescue me<br />
<br />
In the cold mirror of a glass<br />
I see my reflection pass<br />
<br>
I see the dark shades of what I used to be<br />
I see the purple of her eyes<br />
The scarlet of my lies<br />
Love, rescue me<br />
<br />
Yeah, though I walk<br />
In the valley of the shadow<br />
Yet, I will fear no evil<br />
I have cursed thy rod and staff<br />
They no longer comfort me<br />
Love, rescue me<br />
<br />
Sha la la la etc<br />
I said love, love, rescue me<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm here without a name<br />
In the palace of my shame<br />
I said love, rescue me<br />
<br />
I've conquered my past<br />
The future is here at last<br />
I stand at the entrance to a new world I can see<br />
The ruins to the right of me<br />
Will soon have lost sight of me<br />
Love, rescue me</p>
