Senor, senor, can you tell me where we're headin'?<br />
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?<br />
Seem like I been down this way before<br />
Is there any truth in that, senor?<br />
<br />
Senor, senor, do you know where she's hidin'?<br />
How long are we gonna be ridin'?<br />
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?<br />
Will there be any comfort there, senor?<br />
<br />
There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck<br />
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck<br />
There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot<br />
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."<br />
<br />
Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon<br />
I can smell the tail of the dragon<br />
<br>
Can't stand the suspense anymore<br />
Can you tell me who to contact here, senor?<br />
<br />
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled<br />
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field<br />
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring<br />
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."<br />
<br />
Senor, senor, you know their hearts they're as hard as leather<br />
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together<br />
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor<br />
I'm ready when you are, senor<br />
<br />
Senor, senor, let's overturn these tables<br />
Disconnect these cables <br />
This place don't make sense to me no more<br />
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor?</p>
