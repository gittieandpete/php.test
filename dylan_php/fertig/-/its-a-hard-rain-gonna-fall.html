Tell me where have you been, my blue-eyed son?<br />
Where have you been, my darling young one?<br />
I've stumbled up on the side of twelve misty mountains<br />
I've walked and I've crawled over six crooked highways<br />
I've stepped out in the middle of seven sad forests<br />
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans<br />
But I tell ya it's hard, yeah it's hard, well it's hard<br />
Oh it's hard, girl<br />
It's a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
<br />
Tell me what did you see, my blue-eyed son?<br />
What did you see, my darling young one?<br />
I saw a black branch dripping with blood all around it<br />
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleedin'<br />
I saw a white ladder all covered with water<br />
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken<br />
Well it's hard, yes it's hard, yes it's hard<br />
Oh yeah<br />
It's a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
<br />
Tell me what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br />
What did you hear, my darling young one?<br />
<br>
I heard one hundred drummers, hands that were blazin'<br />
Ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'<br />
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'<br />
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter<br />
Well it's hard, yes it's hard, yes it's hard<br />
Oh it's hard yeah<br />
It's a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
<br />
Well what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?<br />
What'll you do now, my darling young one?<br />
Well I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest<br />
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty<br />
Where the pellets of poison are flooding the waters<br />
But I'll know my song well and I sure won't forget it<br />
â€˜Cos it's hard, yes it's hard, well it's hard<br />
Oh yeah<br />
It's a hard rain's gonna fall<br />
<br />
Wah-hoo<br />
Wah-hoo<br />
Wah-hoo<br />
Wah-hoo</p>
