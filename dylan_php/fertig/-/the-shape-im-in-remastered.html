Go out yonder, peace in the valley<br />
Come downtown, have to rumble in the alley<br />
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in<br />
Has anybody seen my lady<br />
This living alone will drive me crazy<br />
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in<br />
I'm gonna go down by the wa - ter<br />
But I ain't gonna jump in, no, no<br />
I'll just be looking for my mak - er<br />
And I hear that that's where she's been? oh<br />
Out of nine lives, I spent seven<br />
<br>
Now, how in the world do you get to heaven<br />
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in<br />
I just spent 60 days in the jailhouse<br />
For the crime of having no dough<br />
Now here I am back out on the street<br />
For the crime of having nowhere to go<br />
Save your neck or save your brother<br />
Looks like it's one or the other<br />
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in<br />
Now two young kids might start a ruckus<br />
You know they feel you trying to shuck us<br />
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in</p>
