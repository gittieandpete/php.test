Twas in the merry month of May<br />
When green buds all were swelling<br />
Sweet William on his death bed lay<br />
For love of Barbara Allen<br />
<br />
He sent his servant to the town<br />
To the place where she was dwelling<br />
Saying you must come, to my master dear<br />
If your name be Barbara Allen<br />
<br />
So slowly, slowly she got up<br />
And slowly she drew nigh him<br />
And the only words to him did say<br />
Young man I think you're dying<br />
<br />
He turned his face unto the wall<br />
And death was in him welling<br />
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all<br />
Be good to Barbara Allen<br />
<br />
When he was dead and laid in grave<br />
She heard the death bells knelling<br />
<br>
And every stroke to her did say<br />
Hard hearted Barbara Allen<br />
<br />
Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave<br />
Make it both long and narrow<br />
Sweet William died of love for me<br />
And I will die of sorrow<br />
<br />
And father, oh father, go dig my grave<br />
Make it both long and narrow<br />
Sweet William died on yesterday<br />
And I will die tomorrow<br />
<br />
Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard<br />
Sweet William was buried beside her<br />
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose<br />
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar<br />
<br />
They grew and grew in the old churchyard<br />
Till they could grow no higher<br />
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot<br />
And the rose grew round the briar</p>
