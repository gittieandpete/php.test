Now, I try, oh for so awf'ly long<br />
And I just try to be.<br />
And now, oh it's a gold mine<br />
But it's so fine.<br />
Yes, but I know in my head<br />
That we're all so misled,<br />
And it's that ol' sign on the cross<br />
That worries me.<br />
<br />
Now, when I was just a bawlin' child,<br />
I saw what I wanted to be,<br />
And it's all for the sake<br />
Of that picture I should see.<br />
But I was lost on the moon<br />
As I heard that front door slam,<br />
And that old sign on the cross<br />
Still worries me.<br />
<br />
Well, it's that old sign on the cross,<br />
Well, it's that old key to the kingdom,<br />
Well, it's that old sign on the cross<br />
Like you used to be.<br />
<br />
But, when I hold my head so high<br />
As I see my ol' friends go by,<br />
And it's still that sign on the cross<br />
<br>
That worries me.<br />
<br />
Well, it seems to be the sign on the cross. Ev'ry day,<br />
ev'ry night, see the sign on the cross just layin' up<br />
on top of the hill. Yes, we thought it might have<br />
disappeared long ago, but I'm here to tell you, friends,<br />
that I'm afraid it's lyin' there still. Yes, just a<br />
little time is all you need, you might say, but I don't<br />
know 'bout that any more, because the bird is here and<br />
you might want to enter it, but, of course, the door might<br />
be closed. But I just would like to tell you one time,<br />
if I don't see you again, that the thing is, that the sign<br />
on the cross is the thing you might need the most.<br />
<br />
Yes, the sign on the cross<br />
Is just a sign on the cross.<br />
Well, there is some on every chisel<br />
And there is some in the championship, too.<br />
Oh, when your, when your days are numbered<br />
And your nights are long,<br />
You might think you're weak<br />
But I mean to say you're strong.<br />
Yes you are, if that sign on the cross,<br />
If it begins to worry you.<br />
Well, that's all right because sing a song<br />
And all your troubles will pass right on through.</p>
