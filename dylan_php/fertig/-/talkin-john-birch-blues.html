Well, I was feeling sad and feeling&rsquo; blue<br />
I didn&rsquo;t know what in the world I wus gonna do<br />
Them Communists they wus coming around<br />
They wus in the air<br />
They wus on the ground<br />
They wouldn&rsquo;t give me no peace<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
So I run down most hurriedly<br />
And joined up with the John Birch Society<br />
I got me a secret membership card<br />
And started off a-walking down the road<br />
Yee-hoo, I&rsquo;m a real John Bircher now!<br />
Look out you Commies!<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Now we all agree with Hitler&rsquo;s views<br />
Although he killed six million Jews<br />
It don&rsquo;t matter too much that he was a Fascist<br />
At least you can&rsquo;t say he was a Communist!<br />
That&rsquo;s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Well, I woos looking everywhere for them gol-darned Reds<br />
I got up in the morning and looked under my bed<br />
Looked in the sink, behind the door<br />
Looked in the glove compartment of my car<br />
Couldn&rsquo;t find them<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
I woos looking high and low for them Reds everywhere<br />
I woos looking in the sink and underneath the chair<br />
I looked way up my chimney hole<br />
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl<br />
They got away<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
Well, I woos sitting home alone and started to sweat<br />
Figured they woos in my T.V. set<br />
Peeked behind the picture frame<br />
Got a shock from my feet, hitting right up in the brain<br />
Them Reds caused it!<br />
I know they did them hard-core ones<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone<br />
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes<br />
Followed some clues from my detective bag<br />
And discovered they woos red stripes on the American flag!<br />
That old Betsy Ross<br />
<br />
[Verse 8]<br />
Well, I investigated all the books in the library<br />
Ninety percent of them gotta be burned away<br />
I investigated all the people that I know<br />
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go<br />
The other two percent are fellow Birchers just like me<br />
<br />
[Verse 9]<br />
Now Eisenhower, he&rsquo;s a Russian spy<br />
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy<br />
To my knowledge there&rsquo;s just one man<br />
That&rsquo;s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell<br />
I know for a fact he hates Commies because he picketed the movie Exodus<br />
<br />
[Verse 10]<br />
Well, I finally started thinking straight<br />
When I run out of things to investigate<br />
Couldn&rsquo;t imagine doing anything else<br />
So now I&rsquo;m sitting home investigating myself!<br />
Hope I don&rsquo;t find out anything hmm, great God!</p>
