A tear go down<br />
My day is real<br />
But your dying eye<br />
Upon the same<br />
And need just road<br />
For me from you<br />
What paradise<br />
What can I do?<br />
That die for my<br />
And the day is dark<br />
I can['t] believe<br />
[for the end of time]<br />
What I could find<br />
Oh time is rye-ou-lou<br />
'f I fell in love<br />
To fall in love<br />
To fall in love<br />
With you<br />
<br />
The day is dark<br />
Our time is right<br />
Day in the night<br />
Deep in the night<br />
I came [dev] be back<br />
I hear-a my-a surprise<br />
I see it in you live<br />
I knew it in your eyes<br />
Well I feel your love<br />
And I feel no shame<br />
I can't unleash your horde<br />
I call your name<br />
What were to me<br />
What can I do?<br />
To fall in love<br />
To fall in love<br />
To fall in love<br />
With you<br />
<br>
<br />
It just rolls<br />
Upon the sand<br />
[deverthisse] now<br />
I made the man<br />
Can make you feel<br />
What I can find<br />
I know it in my days<br />
Ah in my dreary mind<br />
Oh will ages roll<br />
Will ages fly<br />
I hear your name<br />
Where angel lie<br />
What do I know?<br />
For to come it's true<br />
To fall in love<br />
To fall in love<br />
To fall in love<br />
With you<br />
<br />
How can the doors<br />
A trust on a nail<br />
How can I be surprised<br />
Of most everything<br />
Ah in the distant road<br />
I can['t] be the same<br />
I feel no love<br />
I kill no shame<br />
I can't watch the bay<br />
Out on my an own<br />
We've a destined man<br />
I came atist it all<br />
[I didn't] I could find<br />
Where I could go<br />
To fall in love<br />
To fall in love<br />
To fall in love<br />
With you</p>
