Well the woman I hate, I see her everyday<br />
The woman I love she's so far away<br />
<br />
If you don't think I love you, look what a fool I've been<br />
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in<br />
I'm stealin', I'm stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me<br />
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be<br />
<br />
Well the woman I love she's about my size<br />
She's a married woman, come to see me sometime<br />
<br />
If you don't think I love you, look what a fool I've been<br />
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in<br />
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me<br />
<br>
I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be<br />
<br />
Well put your arms around me like a circle in the sun<br />
Stay with me baby like my easy rider done<br />
<br />
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in<br />
If you don't think I love you, look what a fool I've been<br />
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me<br />
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be<br />
<br />
Well I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me<br />
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be<br />
<br />
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me<br />
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be</p>
