[Verse]<br />
He's got everything He needs, He's an artist, He don't look back [x2]<br />
He can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black<br />
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything He sees [x2]<br />
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole, down upon your knees<br />
<br>
He never stumbles, He's got no place to fall [x2]<br />
He's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all<br />
He wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before He speaks [x2]<br />
He's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique<br />
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes [x2]<br />
For Halloween, buy her a trumpet and for Christmas, give her a drum</p>
