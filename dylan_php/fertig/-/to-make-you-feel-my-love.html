When the rain is blowin' in your face<br />
And the whole world is on your case<br />
I could offer you a warm embrace<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
<br />
When the evenin' shadows and the stars appear<br />
And there's none there to dry your tears<br />
I could hold you for a million years<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
<br />
Oh, I know you haven't made your mind up yet<br />
But I will never do you wrong<br />
I knew it from the moment that we met<br />
No doubt in my mind, we'd be wrong<br />
<br />
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue<br />
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue<br />
<br>
No there's nothin' that I wouldn't do<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
<br />
Oh, when the storms ragin' on the open sea<br />
And on the highway of regret<br />
The winds will change, I'll blow wild and free<br />
You ain't see nothin' like me<br />
<br />
I could make you happy<br />
Make your dreams come true<br />
Though there's nothin' that I wouldn't do<br />
I'll go to the ends of the earth for you<br />
<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
To make you feel my love</p>
