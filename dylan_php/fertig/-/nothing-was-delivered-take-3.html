Nothing was delivered<br />
And I tell this truth to you<br />
Not out of spite or anger<br />
But simply because it's true<br />
Now, I hope you won't object to this<br />
Giving back all of what you owe<br />
The fewer words you have to waste on this<br />
The sooner you can go<br />
<br />
Nothing is better, nothing is best<br />
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest<br />
<br />
Nothing was delivered<br />
But I can't say I sympathize<br />
With what your fate is going to be<br />
Yes, for telling all those lies<br />
Now you must provide some answers<br />
For what you sell has not been received<br />
<br>
And the sooner you come up with them<br />
The sooner you can leave<br />
<br />
Nothing is better, nothing is best<br />
Take heed of this and get plenty rest<br />
<br />
(Now you know)<br />
Nothing was delivered<br />
And it's up to you to say<br />
Just what you had in mind<br />
When you made ev'rybody pay<br />
No, nothing was delivered<br />
Yes, 'n' someone must explain<br />
That as long as it takes to do this<br />
Then that's how long that you'll remain<br />
<br />
Nothing is better, nothing is best<br />
Take heed of this and get plenty rest</p>
