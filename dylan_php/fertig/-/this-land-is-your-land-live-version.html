As I went walking<br />
That ribbon of highway<br />
I saw above me<br />
An endless skyway<br />
I saw below me<br />
That golden valley<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
This land is your land<br />
This land is my land<br />
From California<br />
To the New York island<br />
From the Redwood Forest<br />
To the Gulf Stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
I've roamed and rambled<br />
I followed my footsteps<br />
Through the sunny bright sands of<br />
Her diamond deserts<br />
And all around me<br />
A voice came singing<br />
Singing this land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
This land is your land<br />
And this land is my land<br />
From California<br />
To the New York island<br />
From the Redwood Forest<br />
To the Gulf Stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br>
<br />
It was early one morning<br />
And I was strolling<br />
With the wheat fields waving<br />
And dust clouds rolling<br />
As the fog was lifting<br />
A voice comes chanting<br />
<br />
This land is your land<br />
This land is my land<br />
From California<br />
To the New York island<br />
From the Redwood Forest<br />
To the Gulf Stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
Nobody living<br />
Can ever stop me<br />
As I go walking<br />
My freedom highway<br />
Nobody living<br />
Can make me turn back<br />
This land was made for you and me<br />
<br />
This land is your land<br />
And this land is my land<br />
From California<br />
To the New York island<br />
From the Redwood Forest<br />
To the Gulf Stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>
