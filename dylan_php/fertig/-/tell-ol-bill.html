The river whispers in my ear<br />
I've hardly a penny to my name<br />
The heavens have never seemed so near<br />
All of my body glows with flame<br />
<br />
The tempest struggles in the air<br />
And to myself alone I sing<br />
It could sink me then and there<br />
I can hear the echoes ring<br />
<br />
I tried to find one smiling face<br />
To drive the shadow from my head<br />
I'm stranded in this nameless place<br />
Lying restless in a heavy bed<br />
<br />
Tell me straight out if you will<br />
Why must you torture me within?<br />
Why must you come down off of your high hill?<br />
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind<br />
<br />
Far away in a silent land<br />
Secret thoughts are hard to bear<br />
Remember me, you'll understand<br />
Emotions we can never share<br />
<br />
You trampled on me as you passed<br />
Left the coldest kiss upon my brow<br />
All of my doubts and fears have gone at last<br />
I've nothing more to tell you now<br />
<br>
<br />
I walk by tranquil lakes and streams<br />
As each new season's dawn awaits<br />
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams<br />
The enemy is at the gate<br />
<br />
Beneath the thunder blasted trees<br />
The words are ringin' off your tongue<br />
The ground is hard in times like these<br />
Stars are cold, the night is young<br />
<br />
The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare<br />
Iron clouds go floating by<br />
Snowflakes fallin' in my hair<br />
Beneath the gray and stormy sky<br />
<br />
The evenin' sun is sinkin' low<br />
The woods are dark, the town isn't new<br />
They''ll drag you down, they'll run the show<br />
Ain't no telling what they'll do<br />
<br />
Tell ol' Bill when he comes home<br />
Anything is worth a try<br />
Tell him that I'm not alone<br />
That the hour has come to do or die<br />
<br />
All the world I would defy<br />
Let me make it plain as day<br />
I look at you now and I sigh<br />
How could it be any other way?</p>
