Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br />
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you<br />
<br />
Though I know that evening's empire<br />
Has returned into sand<br />
Vanished from my hand<br />
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping<br />
<br />
My weariness amazes me<br />
I am branded on my feet<br />
I have no one to meet<br />
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming<br />
<br />
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br />
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you<br />
<br />
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship<br />
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip<br />
My toes too numb to step<br />
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering<br />
<br />
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade<br />
Into my own parade<br />
Cast your dancing spell my way<br />
I promise to go under it<br />
<br />
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br />
<br>
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you<br />
<br />
Though you might hear laughing spinning, swinging madly across the sun<br />
It's not aimed at anyone<br />
It's just escaping on the run<br />
And, but for the sky, there are no fences facing<br />
<br />
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme<br />
To your tambourine in time<br />
It's just a ragged clown behind<br />
I wouldn't pay it any mind<br />
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing<br />
<br />
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br />
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you<br />
<br />
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind<br />
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves<br />
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach<br />
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow<br />
<br />
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free<br />
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands<br />
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves<br />
Let me forget about today until tomorrow<br />
<br />
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br />
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br />
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you</p>
