Most of the time, I'm clear focused all around<br />
Most of the time, I can keep both feet on the ground<br />
I can follow the path, I can read the signs<br />
Stay right with it when the road unwinds<br />
I can handle whatever I stumble upon<br />
I don't even notice she's gone<br />
Most of the time<br />
<br />
Most of the time, it's well understood<br />
Most of the time, I wouldn't change it if I could<br />
I can't make it all match up, I can hold my own<br />
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone<br />
I can survive, I can endure<br />
And I don't even think about her<br />
Most of the time<br />
<br />
Most of the time, my head is on straight<br />
Most of the time, I'm strong enough not to hate<br />
<br>
I don't build up illusion 'till it makes me sick<br />
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick<br />
I can smile in the face of mankind<br />
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine<br />
Most of the time<br />
<br />
Most of the time, she ain't even in my mind<br />
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind<br />
Most of the time, I can't even be sure<br />
If she was ever with me or if I was with her<br />
<br />
Most of the time, I'm halfway content<br />
Most of the time, I know exactly where it all went<br />
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide<br />
Hide from the feelings, that are buried inside<br />
I don't compromise and I don't pretend<br />
I don't even care if I ever see her again<br />
Most of the time</p>
