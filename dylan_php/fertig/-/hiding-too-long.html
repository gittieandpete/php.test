Come you phoney super patriotic people that say<br />
That hatin' and fearing is my only way<br />
That this here country has got to be<br />
You're thinkin' of yourselves, you ain't thinkin' of me<br />
<br />
You're not thinkin' of any George Washington<br />
You're not thinkin' of any Thomas Jefferson<br />
But you say that you are and you lie and mislead<br />
You use their names for aims, for your selfish greed<br />
<br />
Don't speak to me of your patriotism<br />
When you throw the Southern black boy in prison<br />
<br>
An' you say that the only good niggers are the ones that have died<br />
Don't think I'll ever stand on your side<br />
<br />
Though you make it so hard for me to love<br />
My face will never feel the slap of your glove<br />
My cards will never buy..<br />
My hands will never buy the cards that you play<br />
My feet will never walk down the road that you lay<br />
<br />
Get out in the open, stop standin' afar<br />
Let the whole world see what a hypocrit you are<br />
I ain't jokin' and it ain't no gag<br />
You bin hidin' too long behind the American flag</p>
