(It's Hell time, man)<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
<br />
Down these streets the fools rule<br />
There's no freedom or self respect<br />
A knife's point or a trip to the joint<br />
Is about all you can expect<br />
<br />
They kill people here who stand up for their rights<br />
The system's just too damned corrupt<br />
It's always the same, the name of the game<br />
Is who do you know higher up<br />
Well..<br />
 <br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
<br />
The blacks and the whites<br />
The idiotic, the exotic<br />
Wealth is a filthy rag<br />
So erotic so unpatriotic<br />
So wrapped up in the American flag<br />
<br />
Witchcraft scum exploiting the dumb<br />
Turning children into punks and slaves<br />
Whose heroes and healers are rich dope dealers<br />
Who should be put in their graves<br />
Tell the truth now..<br />
<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
Well, lookie here, honey<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
<br />
Listen to me Mr. Pussyman<br />
This might be your last night in a bed so soft<br />
<br>
We're not pimps on the make, politicians on the take<br />
You can't pay us off<br />
<br />
We're gonna blow up your home of Voodoo<br />
And watch it burn without any regret<br />
We got the power we're the new government<br />
You just don't know it yet<br />
Help me now..<br />
<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
Ah, bring it to me honey<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
<br />
For all of my brothers from Vietnam<br />
And my uncles from World War II<br />
I'd like to say that it's countdown time now<br />
And we're gonna do what the law should do<br />
<br />
And for you pretty baby<br />
I know you've seen it all<br />
I know your story is too painful to share<br />
One day though you'll be talking in your sleep<br />
And when you do, I wanna be there<br />
Yeah..<br />
<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
Be strong, baby<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
Won't take long, baby<br />
(Band of the hand)<br />
Ah, let me tell you now<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
The war is here, honey<br />
(Band of the hand)<br />
Ah, go ahead now<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
Be strong, baby<br />
(Band of the hand)<br />
It won't be long, honey<br />
(It's Hell time, man)<br />
Be strong, baby</p>
