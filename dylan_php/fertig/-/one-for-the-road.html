One for the road<br />
One for my baby<br />
One for the road<br />
<br />
I cry alone at night<br />
Please tell me it's only night<br />
And she's calling me back at night<br />
And she's already home<br />
<br />
One for my baby<br />
One for the road<br />
One for my baby<br />
One for the road<br />
<br />
I cry alone at night<br />
There is no friend in sight<br />
I love getting back at night<br />
But I wish I don't<br />
<br />
One for my baby<br />
One for the road<br />
<br>
One for my baby<br />
One for the road<br />
<br />
This bottle is dried up too<br />
And I'll be all cried up soon<br />
I can't see no God on the moon<br />
It's a long way to go<br />
<br />
One for my baby<br />
One for the road<br />
One for my baby<br />
One for the road<br />
<br />
I cry alone at night<br />
He's not alone at night<br />
I'll be there my whole night<br />
But I wish it was whole<br />
<br />
One for my baby<br />
One for the road<br />
One for my baby<br />
One for the road</p>
