Love is a burnin' thing,<br />
And it makes a fiery ring<br />
Bound by wild desire<br />
I fell into a ring of fire.<br />
<br />
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire<br />
I went down, down, down<br />
And the flames went higher,<br />
And it burns, burns, burns,<br />
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.<br />
<br />
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire<br />
I went down, down, down<br />
And the flames went higher,<br />
And it burns, burns, burns,<br />
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.<br />
<br />
The taste of love is sweet<br />
When hearts like ours meet.<br />
<br>
I fell for you like a child<br />
Oh, but the fire went wild.<br />
<br />
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire<br />
I went down, down, down<br />
And the flames went higher,<br />
And it burns, burns, burns,<br />
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.<br />
<br />
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire<br />
I went down, down, down,<br />
And the flames went higher,<br />
And it burns, burns, burns,<br />
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.<br />
<br />
And it burns, burns, burns,<br />
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.<br />
The ring of fire, the ring of fire<br />
The ring of fire</p>
