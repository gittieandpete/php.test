Times ain't what they used to be<br />
Times ain't what they used to be<br />
Oh I tell you people, lord, you can take it from me<br />
<br />
Oh I seen better days and I'm putting up with these<br />
Oh I seen better days and I'm putting up with these<br />
But there's too many people and they're all too hard to please<br />
<br />
Cause I was born in the country, she thinks I'm easy to rule<br />
Cause I was born in the country, she thinks I'm easy to rule<br />
She tried to hitch me to her wagon, she wants to drive me like a mule<br />
<br />
You know I bought the groceries and I paid the rent<br />
You know I bought the groceries and I paid the rent<br />
She tried to make me wash her clothes but I got good common sense<br />
<br>
<br />
I said if you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?<br />
I said if you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?<br />
Cause it ain't like a man that ain't got nowhere to go<br />
<br />
I believe I'm giving you sugar for sugar, let you get salt for salt<br />
I believe I'm giving you sugar for sugar, let you get salt for salt<br />
And if you can't get along with me, well it's your own fault<br />
<br />
Now you want me to love you and you treat me mean<br />
How do you want me to love you if you keep a-treating me mean?<br />
You're my daily thought and my nightly dream<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think that you too sweet to die<br />
Sometimes I think that you too sweet to die<br />
And another time I think you ought to be buried alive</p>
