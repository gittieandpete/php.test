<br />
Denise, Denise<br />
Gal, what's on your mind?<br />
Denise, Denise<br />
Gal, what's on your mind?<br />
You got your eyes closed<br />
Heaven knows that you ain't blind<br />
<br />
Well, I can see you smiling<br />
But oh your mouth is inside out<br />
I can see you smiling<br />
But you're smiling inside out<br />
Well, I know you're laughin'<br />
But what are you laughin' about<br />
<br />
Well, if you're tryin' to throw me<br />
Babe, I've already been tossed<br />
<br>
If you're tryin' to throw me<br />
Babe, I've already been tossed<br />
Babe, you're tryin' to lose me<br />
Babe, I'm already lost<br />
<br />
Well, what are you doing<br />
Are you flying or have you flipped?<br />
Oh, what are you doing<br />
Are you flying or have you flipped?<br />
Well, you call my name<br />
And then say your tongue just slipped<br />
<br />
Denise, Denise<br />
You're concealed here on the shelf<br />
Denise, Denise<br />
You're concealed here on the shelf<br />
I'm looking deep in your eyes, babe<br />
And all I can see is myself</p>
