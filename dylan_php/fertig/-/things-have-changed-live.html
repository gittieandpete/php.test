A worried man with a worried mind<br />
No one in front of me and nothing behind<br />
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne<br />
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes<br />
I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies<br />
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train<br />
<br />
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose<br />
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose<br />
<br />
People are crazy and times are strange<br />
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range<br />
I used to care, but things have changed<br />
<br />
This place ain't doing me any good<br />
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood<br />
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move<br />
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag<br />
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag<br />
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove<br />
<br />
Lot of water under the bridge, Lot of other stuff too<br />
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through<br />
<br />
People are crazy and times are strange<br />
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range<br />
I used to care, but things have changed<br />
<br>
<br />
I've been walking forty miles of bad road<br />
If the bible is right, the world will explode<br />
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can<br />
Some things are too hot to touch<br />
The human mind can only stand so much<br />
You can't win with a losing hand<br />
<br />
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet<br />
Putting her in a wheel barrow and wheeling her down the street<br />
<br />
People are crazy and times are strange<br />
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range<br />
I used to care, but things have changed<br />
<br />
I hurt easy, I just don't show it<br />
You can hurt someone and not even know it<br />
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity<br />
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high<br />
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie<br />
I'm in love with a woman who don't even appeal to me<br />
<br />
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake<br />
I'm not that eager to make a mistake<br />
<br />
People are crazy and times are strange<br />
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range<br />
I used to care, but things have changed</p>
