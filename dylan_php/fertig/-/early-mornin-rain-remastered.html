In the early morning rain, with a dollar in my hand<br />
With an aching in my heart, and my pockets full of sand<br />
I'm a long way from home, and I miss my loved ones so<br />
In the early morning rain, with nowhere to go<br />
<br />
Out on runway number nine, a big 707's set to go<br />
I'm stuck here in the ground, where the cold wind blows<br />
The liquor tasted good, and the women all were fast<br />
There she goes my friend, she's rolling down at last<br />
<br>
<br />
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high<br />
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly<br />
Where the morning rain don't fall, and the sun always shines<br />
She'll be flying over my home, in about three hours time<br />
<br />
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me<br />
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be<br />
You can't jump a jet plane, like you can a freight train<br />
So I'd best be on my way, in the early morning rain</p>
