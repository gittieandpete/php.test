Rain all around, windshield wipers movin'<br />
Water on the ground, sure don't feel like groovin'<br />
Working on a guru<br />
Working on a guru<br />
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Rain all around, I need me an umbrella<br />
Water on the ground, I am that kind of fella<br />
Looking for a guru<br />
Working on a guru<br />
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Walking on the street, I need me an umbrella<br />
Just to keep it sweet, I am that kind of fella<br />
<br>
Looking for a guru<br />
Working on a guru<br />
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Rain on the ground, windshield wipers movin'<br />
Water all around, I sure don't feel like groovin'<br />
I'm working on a guru<br />
Yes, I'm working on a guru<br />
But I'm working on a guru, before the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Working on a guru<br />
Working on a guru<br />
Well, it's true, it could be you<br />
I'm working on a guru</p>
