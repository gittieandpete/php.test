Come, gather round people wherever you roam<br />
And admit that the waters around you have grown<br />
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone<br />
If your time to you is worth saving<br />
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone<br />
For the times, they are a-changin<br />
<br />
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pens<br />
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again<br />
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin<br />
And there's no telling who that it's naming<br />
Oh, the loser now will be later to win<br />
For the times they are a-changin'<br />
<br />
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call<br />
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall<br />
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled<br />
<br>
There's a battle outside ragin'<br />
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your halls<br />
For the times, they are a-changin<br />
<br />
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land<br />
And don't criticize what you can't understand<br />
Your sons and your daughter are beyond your command<br />
Your old world is rapidly aging<br />
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand<br />
For the times they are a-changin<br />
<br />
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast<br />
The slow one now will later be fast<br />
As the present now will later be past<br />
The order is rapidly fading<br />
The first one now will later be last<br />
For the times, they are a-changin!</p>
