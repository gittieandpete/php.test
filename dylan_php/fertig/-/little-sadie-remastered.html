I went out last night to take a little round<br />
I met my Little Sadie and I brought her down<br />
I ran right home and I went to bed<br />
With a forty-four smokeless under my head<br />
I went out last night to take a little round<br />
I met my Little Sadie and I brought her down<br />
I ran right home and I went to bed<br />
With a forty-four smokeless under my head<br />
I began to think what a deed I'd done<br />
I grabbed my hat and the way I've run<br />
I made a good run but I ran too slow<br />
They overtook me down in Jericho<br />
Standin' on a corner, ringin' my bell<br />
Up stepped Sheriff from Thomasville<br />
<br>
He said, "Young man is you name Brown?<br />
Remember the night that you blowed Little Sadie down"<br />
"Oh yes, Sir, my name is Lee<br />
I murdered Little Sadie in the first degree<br />
First degree and second degree<br />
You got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"<br />
Took me down town and they dressed me in black<br />
They put me on a train and they brought me back<br />
I had no one to go my bail<br />
Crammed me back into the county jail<br />
Judge and jury took their stand<br />
Judge had the papers in his hand<br />
Forty-one days, forty-one nights<br />
Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes</p>
