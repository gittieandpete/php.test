Don't ever take yourself away<br />
Don't ever take yourself<br />
To a place where I can't find you<br />
Don't ever take yourself away<br />
<br />
I will never leave you<br />
Will never deceive you<br />
I'll be right there walkin' behind you<br />
<br />
Dearest, I think you're the one<br />
I can't imagine anybody doin'<br />
More to me than you do<br />
<br />
Dearest, if it's your heart that I won<br />
There's no need for blame<br />
And no reason to be ashamed<br />
Of that place where we stand in the sun<br />
<br />
Don't ever take yourself away<br />
Don't ever take yourself<br />
To a place where I can't find you<br />
Don't ever take yourself away<br />
<br />
I will never leave you<br />
I will never deceive you<br />
I'll be right there walkin' behind you<br />
<br />
Dearest, let us not drift apart<br />
It wouldn't be wise<br />
It wouldn't be civilized<br />
It wouldn't be smart<br />
<br>
<br />
Time heals a broken heart<br />
You've been hurt<br />
You've been left in the dirt<br />
But you still look brand new to me<br />
<br />
Don't ever take yourself away<br />
Don't ever take yourself<br />
To a place where I can't find you<br />
Don't ever take yourself away<br />
<br />
I will never leave you<br />
I will never deceive you<br />
I'll be right there walkin' behind you<br />
<br />
Dearest, you're the answer to my prayers<br />
Words can't express<br />
If my heart would confess<br />
What you mean to me<br />
<br />
Dearest, I can't help knowin' that you're the best<br />
I don't have to feel you to know that you're real<br />
You're more than a dream to me<br />
<br />
Don't ever take yourself away<br />
Don't ever take yourself<br />
To a place where I can't find you<br />
Don't ever take yourself away<br />
<br />
I will never leave you<br />
I will never deceive you<br />
I'll be right there walking behind you</p>
