Someone's got it in for me<br />
They're planting stories in the press<br />
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out quick<br />
But when they will I can only guess<br />
They say I shot a man named Gray<br />
And took his wife to Italy<br />
She inherited a million bucks<br />
And when she died it came to me<br />
I can't help it if I'm lucky<br />
People see me all the time<br />
And they just can't remember how to act<br />
Their minds are filled with big ideas<br />
Images and distorted facts<br />
Even you, yesterday<br />
You had to ask me where it was at<br />
I couldn't believe after all these years<br />
You didn't know me better than that<br />
Sweet lady<br />
Idiot wind<br />
Blowing every time you move your mouth<br />
Blowing down the back roads headin' south<br />
Idiot wind<br />
Blowing every time you move your teeth<br />
You're an idiot, babe<br />
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe<br />
I ran into the fortune-teller<br />
Who said beware of lightning that might strike<br />
I haven't known peace and quiet<br />
For so long I can't remember what it's like<br />
There's a lone soldier on the cross<br />
Smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door<br />
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done<br />
In the final end he won the wars<br />
After losin' every battle<br />
I woke up on the roadside<br />
Daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are<br />
Visions of your chestnut mare<br />
Shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars<br />
You hurt the ones that I love best<br />
And cover up the truth with lies<br />
One day you'll be in the ditch<br />
Flies buzzin' around your eyes<br />
Blood on your saddle<br />
Idiot wind<br />
Blowing through the flowers on your tomb<br />
Blowing through the curtains in your room<br />
Idiot wind<br />
Blowing every time you move your teeth<br />
You're an idiot, babe<br />
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe<br />
<br>
It was gravity which pulled us down<br />
And destiny which broke us apart<br />
You tamed the lion in my cage<br />
But it just wasn't enough to change my heart<br />
Now everything's a little upside down<br />
As a matter of fact the wheels have stopped<br />
What's good is bad, what's bad is good<br />
You'll find out when you reach the top<br />
You're on the bottom<br />
I noticed at the ceremony<br />
Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind<br />
I can't remember your face anymore<br />
Your mouth has changed<br />
Your eyes don't look into mine<br />
The priest wore black on the seventh day<br />
And sat stone-faced while the building burned<br />
I waited for you on the running boards<br />
Near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned<br />
Slowly into autumn<br />
Idiot wind<br />
Blowing like a circle around my skull<br />
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol<br />
Idiot wind<br />
Blowing every time you move your teeth<br />
You're an idiot, babe<br />
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe<br />
I can't feel you anymore<br />
I can't even touch the books you've read<br />
Every time I crawl past your door<br />
I been wishin' I was somebody else instead<br />
Down the highway, down the tracks<br />
Down the road to ecstasy<br />
I followed you beneath the stars<br />
Hounded by your memory<br />
And all your ragin' glory<br />
I been double-crossed now<br />
For the very last time and now I'm finally free<br />
I kissed goodbye the howling beast<br />
On the borderline which separated you from me<br />
You'll never know the hurt I suffered<br />
Nor the pain I rise above<br />
And I'll never know the same about you<br />
Your holiness or your kind of love<br />
And it makes me feel so sorry<br />
Idiot wind<br />
Blowing through the buttons of our coats<br />
Blowing through the letters that we wrote<br />
Idiot wind<br />
Blowing through the dust upon our shelves<br />
We're idiots, babe<br />
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves</p>
