Strange things have happened like never before<br />
My baby told me, I would have to go<br />
I can't be good no more<br />
Once like I did before<br />
I can't be good, baby<br />
Honey, because the world gone wrong<br />
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home<br />
No use in worrying, 'cause the world gone wrong<br />
I can't be good no more<br />
Once like I did before<br />
I can't be good, baby<br />
Honey, because the world gone wrong<br />
I told you, baby, right to your head<br />
If I didn't leave you I would have to kill you dead<br />
I can't be good no more<br />
Once like I did before<br />
I can't be good, baby<br />
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong<br />
I tried to be loving and treat you kind<br />
But it seems like you're never right, you got no loyal mind<br />
I can't be good no more<br />
<br>
Once like I did before<br />
I can't be good, baby<br />
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong<br />
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind<br />
Praise the good Lord, to get her out of your mind<br />
I can't be good no more<br />
Once like I did before<br />
I can't be good, baby<br />
Honey, because the world gone wrong<br />
Said, when you've been good now, can't do no more<br />
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door"<br />
I can't be good no more<br />
Once like I did before<br />
I can't be good, baby<br />
Honey, because the world's gone wrong<br />
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat<br />
No use to ask me, baby, I'll never be back<br />
I can't be good no more<br />
Once like I did before<br />
I can't be good, baby<br />
Honey, because the world gone wrong</p>
