Did ya read about the flood?<br />
Happened long time ago<br />
In Tupelo, Mississippi<br />
There were thousands o' lives<br />
Destroyed<br />
<br />
It rained, it rained<br />
Both night and day<br />
The poor people was worried<br />
Didn't have no place to go<br />
<br />
Could hear may people, cryin' "Lord, have mercy"<br />
'Cause You're the only one that we can turn to"<br />
<br />
Happened a long time ago<br />
A little town<br />
<br>
Way back in Mississippi<br />
In Tupelo<br />
<br />
There was women, and there was children<br />
They were screamin' an' cryin'<br />
Cryin', "Lord, have mercy<br />
You're the only one now, that we can turn to"<br />
<br />
Way back down in Mississippi, a little country town<br />
I know ya read about it<br />
'Cause I'll never forget it<br />
The mighty flood in Tupelo, Mississippi<br />
Been years ago<br />
<br />
Lord, have mercy<br />
Wasn't that a mighty time?<br />
Tupelo's gone</p>
