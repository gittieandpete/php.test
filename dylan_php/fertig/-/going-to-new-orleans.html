I'm goin' down to New Orleans, baby, behind the rising sun<br />
Goin' down to New Orleans, baby, behind the rising sun<br />
Lord, I've just found out, my trouble has just begun<br />
<br />
Oh, went to see a gypsy woman, have my fortune told<br />
Went to see that gypsy woman, have my fortune told, have my fortune told<br />
She said: "You're a good boy, Bobby. Man, you just got a bad luck soul."<br />
<br />
I got a 32 special built on a cross of wood<br />
<br>
I got a 32 special built on a cross of wood<br />
I got a 38-20 well, it's twice as good<br />
<br />
I'm goin' down to New Orleans, mama, with my hat in my hand<br />
Goin' down to New Orleans, mama, with my hat in my hand<br />
Now, I hate to leave you, but you just don't understand<br />
<br />
I'm goin' down to New Orleans, baby, behind the rising sun<br />
Goin' down to New Orleans, baby, behind the rising sun<br />
Lord, I've just found out, my trouble has just begun</p>
