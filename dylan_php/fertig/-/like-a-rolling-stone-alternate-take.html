Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br />
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?<br />
People call, say, "Beware doll you're bound to fall"<br />
You thought they were all kiddin' you<br />
<br />
You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out<br />
Now you don't talk so loud<br />
Now you don't seem so proud<br />
About having to be scrounging your next meal<br />
<br />
How does it feel?<br />
How does it feel?<br />
To be without a home<br />
Like a complete unknown<br />
Like a rolling stone<br />
<br />
You've gone to the finest school, all right Miss Lonely<br />
But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br />
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street<br />
And now you're gonna have to get used to it<br />
<br />
You said you'd never compromise with the mystery tramp<br />
But now you realize, he's not selling any alibis<br />
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br />
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"<br />
<br />
How does it feel?<br />
How does it feel?<br />
To be on your own<br />
With no direction home<br />
A complete unknown<br />
Like a rolling stone<br />
<br />
<br>
You never turned around to see the frowns<br />
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you<br />
Never understood that it ain't no good<br />
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you<br />
<br />
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat<br />
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br />
Ain't it hard when you discover that he really wasn't where it's at?<br />
After he took from you everything he could steal<br />
<br />
How does it feel?<br />
How does it feel?<br />
To be on your own<br />
With no direction home<br />
Like a complete unknown<br />
Like a rolling stone<br />
<br />
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people<br />
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made<br />
Exchanging all precious gifts<br />
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe<br />
<br />
You used to be so amused at Napoleon in rags<br />
And the language that he used, go to him now he calls you<br />
You can't refuse, when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br />
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal<br />
<br />
How does it feel?<br />
How does it feel?<br />
To be on your own<br />
With no direction home<br />
Like a complete unknown<br />
Like a rolling stone</p>
