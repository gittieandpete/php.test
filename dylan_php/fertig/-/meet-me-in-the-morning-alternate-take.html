Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha<br />
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha<br />
Honey, we could be in Kansas<br />
By time the snow begins to thaw<br />
<br />
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn<br />
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn<br />
Honey you wouldn't know it by me<br />
Every day's been darkness since you been gone<br />
<br />
Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind<br />
Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind<br />
<br>
Well, I feel just like that rooster<br />
Honey, ya treat me so unkind<br />
<br />
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above<br />
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above<br />
Well, you know I even outrun the hound dogs<br />
Honey, you know I've earned your love<br />
<br />
Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship<br />
Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship<br />
Ain't that just like my heart, babe<br />
When you kissed my lips?</p>
