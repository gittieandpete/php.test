They're selling postcards of the hanging<br />
They're painting the passports brown<br />
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors<br />
The circus is in town<br />
<br />
Here comes the blind commissioner<br />
They've got him in a trance<br />
One hand is tied to the tightrope walker<br />
The other is in his pants<br />
<br />
And the riot squad, they're restless<br />
They need somewhere to go<br />
As Lady and I look out tonight<br />
From Desolation Row<br />
<br />
Cinderella, she seems so easy<br />
"It takes one to know one," she smiles<br />
And puts her hands in her back pocket<br />
Bette Davis style<br />
<br />
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning<br />
"You belong to me, I believe"<br />
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend<br />
You'd better leave"<br />
<br />
And the only sound that's left<br />
After the ambulances go<br />
Is Cinderella sweeping up<br />
On Desolation Row<br />
<br />
Now the moon is almost hidden<br />
The stars are beginning to hide<br />
The fortune telling lady<br />
Has even taken all her things inside<br />
<br />
All except for Cain and Abel<br />
And the hunchback of Notre Dame<br />
Everybody's making love<br />
Or else expecting rain<br />
<br />
And the good Samaritan, he's dressing<br />
He's getting ready for the show<br />
He's going to the carnival<br />
Tonight on Desolation Row<br />
<br />
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window<br />
For her I feel so afraid<br />
On her 22nd birthday<br />
She already is an old maid<br />
<br />
To her death is quite romantic<br />
She wears an ironed vest<br />
Her profession's her religion<br />
Her sin is her lifelessness<br />
<br />
And though her eyes are fixed upon<br />
Noah's great rainbow<br />
She spends her time peeking into<br />
Desolation Row<br />
<br />
Einstein disguised as Robin Hood<br />
With his memories in a trunk<br />
Passed this way an hour ago<br />
With his friend, a jealous monk<br />
<br />
Now he looked so immaculately frightful<br />
As he bummed a cigarette<br />
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes<br />
And reciting the alphabet<br />
<br />
You would not think to look at him<br />
But he was famous long ago<br />
For playing the electric violin<br />
On Desolation Row<br />
<br>
<br />
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world<br />
Inside of a leather cup<br />
But all his sexless patients<br />
They are trying to blow it up<br />
<br />
Now his nurse, some local loser<br />
She's in charge of the cyanide hole<br />
And she also keeps the cards that read<br />
"Have mercy on his soul"<br />
<br />
They all play on the penny whistle<br />
You can hear them blow<br />
If you lean your head out far enough<br />
From Desolation Row<br />
<br />
Across the street they've nailed the curtains<br />
They're getting ready for the feast<br />
The phantom of the opera<br />
In a perfect image of a priest<br />
<br />
They are spoon-feeding Casanova<br />
To get him to feel more assured<br />
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence<br />
After poisoning him with words<br />
<br />
And the phantom shouting to skinny girls<br />
"Get out of here if you don't know"<br />
Casanova is just being punished<br />
For going to Desolation Row<br />
<br />
At midnight all the agents<br />
And the superhuman crew<br />
Come out and round up everyone<br />
That knows more than they do<br />
<br />
And they bring them to the factory<br />
Where their heart attack machine<br />
Is strapped across their shoulders<br />
And then the kerosene<br />
<br />
Is brought down from the castles<br />
By insurance men who go<br />
Check to see that nobody is escaping<br />
To Desolation Row<br />
<br />
Praise be to Nero's Neptune<br />
The Titanic sails at dawn<br />
Everybody's shouting<br />
"Which side are you on?"<br />
<br />
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Elliot<br />
Fighting in the captain's tower<br />
While calypso singers laugh at them<br />
And fishermen hold flowers<br />
<br />
Between the windows of the sea<br />
Where lovely mermaids flow<br />
And nobody has to think too much<br />
About Desolation Row<br />
<br />
Yes, I received your letter yesterday<br />
About the time the doorknob broke<br />
When you asked me how I was doing<br />
Was that some kind of joke?<br />
<br />
All these people that you mentioned<br />
Yes, I know them, they are quite lame<br />
I had to rearrange their faces<br />
And give them all another name<br />
<br />
Right now I can't read too good<br />
Don't send me no more letters, no<br />
Not unless you mail them from<br />
Desolation Row</p>
