Death don't have no mercy in this land<br />
It don't have no mercy in this land<br />
When i come in your house someday<br />
And i'll take your mother away<br />
<br>
Death don't have no mercy in this land<br />
Death don't have no judgement in this land x2<br />
When i come in your house someday<br />
And i'll take your father away<br />
Death don't have no judgement in this land</p>
