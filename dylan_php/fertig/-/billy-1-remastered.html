There's guns across the river aimin' at ya<br />
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya<br />
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya<br />
Billy, they don't like you to be so free<br />
Campin' out all night on the Berenda<br />
Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the Hacienda<br />
<br>
Up to boot hill they'd like to send ya<br />
Billy, don't you turn your back on me<br />
Playin' around with some sweet Senorita<br />
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya<br />
In the shadows of the [Incomprehensible] she will greet ya<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home</p>
