What's your hurry? Just watch this<br />
This is one you mustn't miss:<br />
Annie's going to sing her song<br />
Called<br />
"Take Me Back Again<br />
<br />
A drink for me, a drink for you;<br />
You're going to need a drink or two:<br />
Annie's going to sing her song<br />
Called<br />
"Take Me Back Again<br />
 <br />
You never heard it sung before;<br />
I hear it twice a month or more<br />
Complete with tears and sheepish grins;<br />
It only lacks the violins<br />
<br />
The tune goes flat from time to time<br />
The lyric sometimes fails to rhyme<br />
But Annie's going to sing her song<br />
Called<br />
"Take Me Back Again<br />
<br />
La la la la la la la<br />
La la la la la la la<br />
Annie's going to sing her song<br />
Called<br />
"Take Me Back Again<br />
<br />
<br>
It sometimes lasts the whole night long<br />
Depends on how long she's been gone<br />
I sit and look as hard as nails;<br />
She knows the damn thing never fails<br />
<br />
Take the bottle, fill your cup;<br />
Don't miss the part where I fold up;<br />
Annie's going to sing her song<br />
Called<br />
"Take Me Back Again<br />
<br />
La la la la la la la<br />
La la la la la la la<br />
Annie's going to sing her song<br />
Called<br />
"Take Me Back Again<br />
<br />
It isn't Annie's only tune;<br />
The other I'll be hearing soon<br />
Next week, tomorrow, or today;<br />
She sings it when she goes away<br />
<br />
Take the bottle, fill your cup;<br />
Don't miss the part where I fold up;<br />
Annie's going to sing her song<br />
Called<br />
"Take Me Back Again;<br />
Come on, Annie, sing you song<br />
Called<br />
"Take Me Back Again</p>
