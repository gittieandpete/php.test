Oh, when I left for Wichita<br />
The weather was a-killin' me<br />
And when I left Wichita<br />
The weather was a-killin' me<br />
Well, my poppa said, "Son<br />
Watch out, you might catch that old TB."<br />
<br />
When I landed in West Memphis<br />
I sure did not have a dime<br />
When I landed in West Memphis<br />
I sure didn't have a dime<br />
Operator said, "Son<br />
Boy, you ain't no friend of mine."<br />
<br>
<br />
Operator, operator<br />
Let that poor boy ride<br />
Operator, operator, oh<br />
Let that poor boy ride<br />
Can't you see me on your road<br />
Lord, I'm singing down by the side<br />
<br />
I'm going down to Louisiana, oh<br />
Mamma, where that red-green river runs<br />
I'm going down to Louisiana<br />
Mamma, where that red-green river runs, yes<br />
You can write and tell my mamma<br />
My ramblin' days have just begun</p>
