I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
<br />
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain<br />
I got a head full of ideas that are drivin' me insane<br />
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor<br />
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more<br />
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more<br />
<br />
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime<br />
He asks you with a grin if you're havin' a good time<br />
Then he fines you every time you slam the door<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more<br />
<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more<br />
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more<br />
<br />
<br>
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks<br />
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks<br />
The National Guard stands around his door<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more<br />
<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more<br />
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more<br />
<br />
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law<br />
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa<br />
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's fifty-four<br />
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more<br />
<br />
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more<br />
<br />
Well, I try my best to be just like I am<br />
But everybody wants you to be just like them<br />
They say sing while you slave and I just get bored<br />
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more</p>
