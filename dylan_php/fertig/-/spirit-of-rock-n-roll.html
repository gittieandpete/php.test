The memories still hold us together<br />
No matter if we're young or old<br />
As long as there's music we'll all live forever<br />
In the spirit of rock and roll<br />
<br />
Once it's in your blood<br />
You won't be the same no more<br />
Reaching every land<br />
From L.A. to Tokyo<br />
It's in the heart of every boy and girl<br />
Everywhere all around the world<br />
<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
<br />
You know Chuck, Buddy, and Elvis paved the road<br />
The roots are deep inside us<br />
It's the rythm in our soul<br />
Now it's the heart that's behind the beat<br />
The only sound that is complete<br />
<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
<br>
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
<br />
Can you hear it<br />
Rockin' to the beachy type the spirit<br />
The spirit the spirit<br />
It's in the heart of every boy and girl<br />
Everywhere around the world<br />
<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll<br />
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)<br />
The spirit of rock n roll</p>
