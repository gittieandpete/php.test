I had a pony, her name was Lucifer<br />
How much longer? How much longer?<br />
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer<br />
How much longer?<br />
She broke her leg and needed shooting<br />
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her<br />
How much longer? How much longer?<br />
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X<br />
How much longer?<br />
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X<br />
How much, how much? How much longer?<br />
She got such a sweet disposition<br />
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next<br />
How much longer? How much longer?<br />
I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace<br />
How much longer?<br />
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace<br />
How much longer?<br />
She got great big hind legs<br />
Long black shaggy hair hanging in her face<br />
<br>
How much, how much? How much longer?<br />
How much, how much? How much longer?<br />
Everybody says you're usin' voodoo<br />
I see your feet walk by themselves<br />
How much, how much? How much longer?<br />
Well everybody says you're usin' voodoo<br />
I've seen your feet walk by themselves<br />
How much, how much? How much longer?<br />
Oh, baby, that God you been prayin' to<br />
Gonna give ya back what you're wishin' on someone else<br />
How much longer? How much longer?<br />
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you<br />
How much longer? Well<br />
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you<br />
How much longer?<br />
You know so nasty and you're so bad<br />
But I said I love you, yes I do<br />
How much, how much? How much longer?<br />
How much, how much longer?<br />
How much, how much longer?</p>
