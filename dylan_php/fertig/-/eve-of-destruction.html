The eastern world it is explodin', violence flarin', bullets loadin'<br />
You're old enough to kill but not for votin'<br />
You don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin'?<br />
<br />
And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'<br />
But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend<br />
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction<br />
<br />
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?<br />
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?<br />
If the button is pushed, there's no running away<br />
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave<br />
<br />
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy<br />
And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend<br />
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction<br />
<br />
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'<br />
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'<br />
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation<br />
<br>
<br />
Handful of Senators don't pass legislation<br />
And marches alone can't bring integration<br />
When human respect is disintegratin'<br />
<br />
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'<br />
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend<br />
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction<br />
<br />
Think of all the hate there is in Red China<br />
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama<br />
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space<br />
But when your return, it's the same old place<br />
<br />
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace<br />
You can bury your dead but don't leave a trace<br />
Hate your next-door-neighbor but don't forget to say grace<br />
<br />
And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend<br />
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction<br />
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction</p>
