Well, I sent for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
Sent for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none<br />
<br />
If she gets unruly, thinks she don't want you<br />
If she gets unruly and thinks she don't want you<br />
Take my .32-20, now, and make her half in two<br />
<br />
She got a .38 special but I believe it's most too light<br />
She got a .38 special but I believe it's most too light<br />
I got a .32-20, make the camp all right<br />
<br />
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none<br />
<br />
Gonna shoot my pistol, gonna shoot my gatling gun<br />
Gonna shoot my pistol, got to shoot my gatling gun<br />
You made me love you, now your man have come<br />
<br>
<br />
Oh, baby, where you stayed last night<br />
Ah, baby, where you stayed last night<br />
You got your hair all tangled and you ain't talking right<br />
<br />
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well<br />
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well<br />
I got a .32-20 now, and it's a-burning<br />
<br />
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
All the doctors in Wisconsin sure can't help her none<br />
<br />
Hey, hey, baby, where you stayed last night<br />
Hey, hey, baby, where you stayed last night<br />
You didn't come home until the sun was shining bright<br />
<br />
Oh, boys, I just can't take my rest<br />
Ah, boys, and I just can't take my rest<br />
With this .32-20 laying up and down my breast</p>
