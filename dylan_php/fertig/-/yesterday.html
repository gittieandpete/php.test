Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away<br />
Now it looks as though they're here to stay<br />
Oh, i believe in yesterday.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, i'm not half the man i used to be,<br />
There's a shadow hanging over me.<br />
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.<br />
<br />
<br>
Why she had to go i don't know she wouldn't say.<br />
I said something wrong, now i long for yesterday.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.<br />
Now i need a place to hide away.<br />
Oh, i believe in yesterday.<br />
<br />
Mm mm mm mm mm.</p>
