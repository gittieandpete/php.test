[Verse 1]<br />
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?<br />
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?<br />
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains<br />
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways<br />
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests<br />
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans<br />
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard<br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard<br />
And it's a hard rain's a-going to fall<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?<br />
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?<br />
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it<br />
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it<br />
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping<br />
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding<br />
I saw a white ladder all covered with water<br />
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken<br />
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children<br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br />
And it's a hard rain's a-going to fall<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br />
And what did you hear, my darling young one?<br />
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warning<br />
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world<br />
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing<br />
Heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening<br />
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing<br />
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter<br />
<br>
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley<br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br />
And it's a hard rain's a-going to fall<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?<br />
Who did you meet, my darling young one?<br />
I met a young child beside a dead pony<br />
I met a white man who walked a black dog<br />
I met a young woman whose body was burning<br />
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow<br />
I met one man who was wounded in love<br />
I met another man who was wounded with hatred<br />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br />
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Oh, what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?<br />
Oh, what will you do now, my darling young one?<br />
I'm a-going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling<br />
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest<br />
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty<br />
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters<br />
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison<br />
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden<br />
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten<br />
Where black is the color, where none is the number<br />
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it<br />
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it<br />
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking<br />
But I'll know my song well before I start singing<br />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br />
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall</p>
