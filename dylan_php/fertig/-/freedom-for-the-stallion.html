Freedom for the stallion<br />
Freedom for the mare and her colt<br />
Freedom for the baby child<br />
Who has not grown old enough to vote<br />
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you?<br />
They got men making laws that destroy other men<br />
They've made money "God"<br />
It's a doggone sin<br />
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way<br />
Big ship's a-sailing, slaves all chained and bound<br />
Heading for a brand new land that some cat said he upped and found<br />
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you?<br />
They got men making laws that destroy other men<br />
<br>
They've made money "God"<br />
It's a doggone sin<br />
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way<br />
Some sing a sad song<br />
Some got to moan the blues<br />
Trying to make the best of a home<br />
That the man didn't even get to choose<br />
Lord, have mercy, how you gonna be with people like John and me<br />
They've got men building fences to keep other men out<br />
Ignore him if he whispers and kill him if he shouts<br />
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way<br />
Oh, Lord, you got to help them find the way<br />
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way</p>
