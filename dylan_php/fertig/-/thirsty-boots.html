You've long been on the open road<br />
You've been sleepin in the rain<br />
From the dirt of words and mud of cell<br />
Your clothes are smeared and stained<br />
But the dirty words and muddy cells<br />
Will soon be judged insane<br />
So only stop and rest yourself<br />
Till you are off again<br />
<br />
So take off your thirsty boots<br />
And stay for a while<br />
Your feet are hot and weary<br />
From a dusty mile<br />
And maybe I can make you laugh<br />
And maybe I can try<br />
I'm just lookin' for the evening<br />
And the morning in your eyes<br />
<br />
But tell me of the ones you saw<br />
As far as you could see<br />
Across the plain from field to town<br />
Marching to be free<br />
And of the rusted prison gates<br />
That tumbled by degree<br />
Like laughing children one by one<br />
Who looked like you and me<br />
<br>
<br />
Take off your thirsty boots<br />
And stay for a while<br />
Your feet are hot and weary<br />
From a dusty mile<br />
And maybe I can make you laugh<br />
And maybe I can try<br />
I'm just lookin' for the evening<br />
And the morning in your eyes<br />
<br />
I know you are no stranger down<br />
The crooked rainbow trails<br />
From dancing cliff-edged shattered sills<br />
Of slender shackled jails<br />
But the voices drift up from below<br />
As the walls are being scaled<br />
All of this and more my friend<br />
Your song shall not be failed<br />
<br />
Then take off your thirsty boots<br />
And stay for a while<br />
Your feet are hot and weary<br />
From a dusty mile<br />
And maybe I can make you laugh<br />
And maybe I can try<br />
I'm just lookin' for the evening<br />
And the morning in your eyes</p>
