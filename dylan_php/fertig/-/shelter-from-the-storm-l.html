'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood<br />
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud<br />
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form<br />
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"<br />
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved<br />
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved<br />
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm<br />
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"<br />
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail<br />
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail<br />
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn<br />
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"<br />
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there<br />
With silver bracelets on her wrist and flowers in her hair<br />
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns<br />
"Come in," she said "I'll give you shelter from the storm"<br />
<br>
And the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount<br />
Nothing really matters much, doom alone that counts<br />
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn<br />
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"<br />
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes<br />
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose<br />
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn<br />
"Come in," she said "I'll give you shelter from the storm"<br />
Now there's a wall between us, something else been lost<br />
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed<br />
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn'<br />
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"<br />
I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line<br />
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make her mine<br />
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born<br />
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</p>
