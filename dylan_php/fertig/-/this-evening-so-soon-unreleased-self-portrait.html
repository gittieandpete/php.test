Remember this?<br />
Remember Bob Gibson?<br />
<br />
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this morning<br />
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this evening<br />
Tell old Bill, when he comes home<br />
To leave them down-town girls alone<br />
This morning, this evening, so soon<br />
<br />
Old Sal was baking bread this morning<br />
Old Sal was baking bread this evening<br />
Old Sal was baking bread<br />
When she found out that her Bill was dead<br />
This morning, this evening, so soon<br />
<br />
She said “Oh no, it can't be so”, this morning<br />
“Oh no, it can't be so”, this evening<br />
<br>
She said “Oh no, it can't be so<br />
My Bill left home about an hour ago”<br />
This morning, this evening, so soon<br />
<br />
Well they brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this morning<br />
They brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this evening<br />
Well you know they brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon<br />
His arms, his legs, his feet were dragging<br />
This morning, this evening, so soon<br />
So soon, so soon, so soon<br />
<br />
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this morning<br />
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this evening<br />
Tell old Bill, when he comes home<br />
To leave them down-town girls alone<br />
This morning, this evening, so soon<br />
So soon, so soon</p>
