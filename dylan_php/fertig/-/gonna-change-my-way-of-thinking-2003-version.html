Change my way of thinking<br />
Make myself a different set of rules<br />
I'm gonna change my way of thinking<br />
Make myself a different set of rules<br />
Gonna put my best foot forward<br />
Stop bein' influenced by fools<br />
Gonna sit at the welcome table<br />
I'm as hungry as a horse<br />
Sitting at the welcome table<br />
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse<br />
I'm gonna revitalize my thinking<br />
I'm gonna let the law take its course<br />
Jesus is calling<br />
He's coming back to gather His jewels<br />
Jesus is coming<br />
He's coming back to gather His jewels<br />
Well, we live by the Golden Rule<br />
Whoever's got the gold, rules<br />
The sun is shining<br />
Ain't but one train on this track<br />
The sun is shining<br />
<br>
Ain't but one train on this track<br />
I'm stepping out of the dark woods<br />
Trying to jump on the monkey's back<br />
Yes, I'm all dressed up<br />
Goin' to the country dance<br />
I said I'm all dressed up<br />
Goin' to the country dance<br />
Everyday you've got to pray for guidance<br />
Everyday you've got to give yourself a chance<br />
There are storms on the ocean<br />
Storms out on the mountains too<br />
Storms on the ocean<br />
Storms on the mountains too<br />
Oh Lord<br />
You know I have no friend without you<br />
I'll tell you something<br />
Things you never had you'll never miss<br />
I'll tell you something<br />
Things you never had you'll never miss<br />
I'll tell you something else, a great man will kill you with a sword<br />
A coward with a kiss</p>
