Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll<br />
We ducked inside a doorway as thunder went crashing<br />
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds<br />
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing<br />
<br />
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight<br />
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight<br />
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night<br />
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing<br />
<br />
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched<br />
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening<br />
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain<br />
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning<br />
<br />
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake<br />
Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked<br />
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake<br />
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing<br />
<br />
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail<br />
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder<br />
As the clanging of the church bells blew far into the breeze<br />
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder<br />
<br />
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind<br />
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind<br />
And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time<br />
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'<br />
<br>
<br />
In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales<br />
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position<br />
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts<br />
All down in taken-for-granted situations<br />
<br />
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute<br />
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute<br />
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit<br />
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing<br />
<br />
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared<br />
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting<br />
Electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones<br />
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'<br />
<br />
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail<br />
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale<br />
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail<br />
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing<br />
<br />
Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught<br />
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended<br />
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look<br />
Spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended<br />
<br />
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed<br />
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse<br />
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe<br />
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'</p>
