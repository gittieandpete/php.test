When you're lost in the rain in Juarez, when it's Easter time too<br />
And your gravity falls and negativity don't pull you through<br />
Don't you put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue<br />
They got some hungry women there, and they'll really make a mess outta you<br />
<br />
Now if you see Saint Annie, please tell her, "Thanks a lot"<br />
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot<br />
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot<br />
And my best friend, my doctor won't even say what it is I've got<br />
<br />
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom<br />
She speaks good English, and she invites you up into her room<br />
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon<br />
And she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon<br />
<br>
<br />
Up on Housing Project Hill, it's either fortune or fame<br />
You must pick one or the other, though neither of them are to be what they claim<br />
If you're lookin' to get silly, you better go back to from where you came<br />
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same<br />
<br />
Now all the authorities, they just stand around and boast<br />
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post<br />
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast<br />
Who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost<br />
<br />
I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff<br />
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough<br />
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff<br />
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough</p>
