Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?<br />
We'll sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it<br />
And Louise holds a handful of rain<br />
Tempting you to defy it<br />
<br />
Lights flicker from the opposite loft<br />
In this room the heat pipes just cough<br />
The country music station plays soft<br />
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off<br />
<br />
Just Louise<br />
And her lover, so entwined<br />
And these visions of Johanna<br />
That conquer my mind<br />
<br />
In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key chain<br />
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D Train<br />
We can hear the nightwatchman click his flashlight<br />
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane<br />
<br />
Louise, she's alright, she's just near<br />
She's delicate and seems like the mirror<br />
But she makes it all to concise and clear<br />
That Johanna's not here<br />
<br />
The ghost of electricity<br />
Howls in the bones of her face<br />
Where these visions of Johanna<br />
Have now taken my place<br />
<br />
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously<br />
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously<br />
And when bringing her name up<br />
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me<br />
<br />
He's sure got a lot of gall<br />
To be so useless and all<br />
Muttering small talk at the wall<br />
<br>
While I'm in the hall<br />
<br />
Oh, how can I explain?<br />
It's so hard to get on<br />
And these visions of Johanna<br />
They've kept me up past the dawn<br />
<br />
Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial<br />
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while<br />
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues<br />
You can tell by the way she smiles<br />
<br />
See the primitive wallflower freeze<br />
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze<br />
Hear the one with the mustache say "Jeez<br />
I can't find my knees"<br />
<br />
Both jewels and binoculars<br />
Hang from the head of the mule<br />
But these visions of Johanna<br />
They make it all seem so cruel<br />
<br />
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him<br />
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him"<br />
But like Louise always says<br />
"You can't look at much, can you man?" as she herself prepares for him<br />
<br />
My Madonna, she still has not showed<br />
We see this empty cage now corrode<br />
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed<br />
The fiddler, he now steps to the road<br />
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"<br />
On the back of the fish truck that loads<br />
While my conscience explodes<br />
<br />
The harmonicas play<br />
The skeleton keys and the rain<br />
And these visions of Johanna<br />
Are now all that remain</p>
