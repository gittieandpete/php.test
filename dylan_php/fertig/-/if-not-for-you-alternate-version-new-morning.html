If not for you<br />
Babe, I couldn't find the door<br />
Couldn't even see the floor<br />
I'd be sad and blue<br />
If not for you<br />
If not for you<br />
Babe, I'd lay awake all night<br />
Wait for the mornin' light<br />
To shine in through<br />
But it would not be new<br />
If not for you<br />
If not for you<br />
My sky would fall<br />
Rain would gather too<br />
<br>
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all<br />
I'd be lost if not for you<br />
And you know it's true<br />
If not for you<br />
My sky would fall<br />
Rain would gather too<br />
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all<br />
Oh! What would I do<br />
If not for you<br />
If not for you<br />
Winter would have no spring<br />
Couldn't hear the robin sing<br />
I just wouldn't have a clue<br />
Anyway it wouldn't ring true<br />
If not for you</p>
