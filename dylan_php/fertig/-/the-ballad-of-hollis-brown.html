Hollis brown<br />
He lived on the outside of town<br />
Hollis brown<br />
He lived on the outside of town<br />
With his wife and five children<br />
And his cabin fallin' down<br />
<br />
You looked for work and money<br />
And you walked a rugged mile<br />
You looked for work and money<br />
And you walked a rugged mile<br />
Your children are so hungry<br />
That they don't know how to smile<br />
<br />
Your baby's eyes look crazy<br />
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve<br />
Your baby's eyes look crazy<br />
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve<br />
You walk the floor and wonder why<br />
With every breath you breathe<br />
<br />
The rats have got your flour<br />
Bad blood it got your mare<br />
The rats have got your flour<br />
Bad blood it got your mare<br />
If there's anyone that knows<br />
Is there anyone that cares?<br />
<br />
You prayed to the lord above<br />
Oh please send you a friend<br />
You prayed to the lord above<br />
Oh please send you a friend<br />
Your empty pockets tell yuh<br />
That you ain't a-got no friend<br />
<br />
Your babies are crying louder<br />
It's pounding on your brain<br />
<br />
<br>
Your babies are crying louder now<br />
It's pounding on your brain<br />
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you<br />
Like the dirty drivin' rain<br />
<br />
Your grass it is turning black<br />
There's no water in your well<br />
Your grass is turning black<br />
There's no water in your well<br />
You spent your last lone dollar<br />
On seven shotgun shells<br />
<br />
Way out in the wilderness<br />
A cold coyote calls<br />
Way out in the wilderness<br />
A cold coyote calls<br />
Your eyes fix on the shotgun<br />
That's hangin' on the wall<br />
<br />
Your brain is a-bleedin'<br />
And your legs can't seem to stand<br />
Your brain is a-bleedin'<br />
And your legs can't seem to stand<br />
Your eyes fix on the shotgun<br />
That you're holdin' in your hand<br />
<br />
There's seven breezes a-blowin'<br />
All around the cabin door<br />
There's seven breezes a-blowin'<br />
All around the cabin door<br />
Seven shots ring out<br />
Like the ocean's pounding roar<br />
<br />
There's seven people dead<br />
On a south dakota farm<br />
There's seven people dead<br />
On a south dakota farm<br />
Somewhere in the distance<br />
There's seven new people born</p>
