They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot<br />
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hotspot<br />
Don't it always go to show<br />
You never know what you got till it's gone?<br />
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot<br />
They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum<br />
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them<br />
Don't it always go to show<br />
You never know what you got till it's gone?<br />
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot<br />
Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T<br />
<br>
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please<br />
Don't it always go to show<br />
You never know what you got till it's gone?<br />
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot<br />
Late last night I heard my screen door slam<br />
A big yellow bulldozer took away the house and land<br />
Don't it always go to show<br />
You never know what you got till it's gone?<br />
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot<br />
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot<br />
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot<br />
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot</p>
