Come all you lads of high renown<br />
That would hear of a fair young maiden<br />
And she roved out on a summer's day<br />
For to view the soldiers paradin'<br />
They marched so bold and they looked so gay<br />
Their colors flyin' and the bands did play<br />
And it caused young Mary for to say<br />
"I'll wed you my gallant soldier."<br />
<br />
She viewed the soldiers on parade<br />
And as they stood at their leisure<br />
Mary to herself did say<br />
"At last I've found my treasure."<br />
"But oh, how cruel my parents must be<br />
Banishing my true love so far from me<br />
Well I'll leave them all and I'll go with thee<br />
My bold undaunted soldier."<br />
<br />
"Oh Mary dear, your parents' love<br />
I pray don't be unruly<br />
For when you're in a foreign land<br />
Believe me you'll rue surely<br />
<br>
Perhaps in battle I might fall<br />
From a shot from an angry cannonball<br />
And you so far from your daddy's hall<br />
Be advised by a gallant soldier."<br />
<br />
"If I have fifty guineas in bright gold<br />
Likewise a heart that's blunder<br />
And I'd leave them all and I'll go with you<br />
My bold undaunted soldier<br />
So don't say no but let me go<br />
And I will face the daring foe<br />
We'll march together to and fro<br />
I'll wed you my gallant soldier."<br />
<br />
And when he saw her loyalty<br />
And Mary so true-hearted<br />
He said, "My darling, married we'll be<br />
And nothin' but death will part us<br />
And when we're in some foreign land<br />
I'll guard you, darling, with my right hand<br />
Hopes that God might stand a friend<br />
To Mary and her gallant soldier."</p>
