And now, because you've all been so sweet, another duet for you<br />
<br />
They say we're young and we don't know<br />
We won't find out until we grow<br />
Well, I don't know, I guess it's true<br />
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you<br />
<br />
Babe<br />
I got you babe<br />
I got you babe<br />
<br />
They say our love won't pay the rent<br />
Before it's earned, our money's always spent<br />
Well, I don't know, we got no plot<br />
Still I'm sure of all the love we got<br />
<br />
Babe<br />
I got you babe<br />
<br>
I got you babe<br />
<br />
I got flowers in the spring<br />
I got you to wear my ring<br />
When I'm sad, you're a clown<br />
When I get scared, you're always 'round<br />
<br />
Some people say your hair's too long<br />
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong<br />
So put your little hand in mine<br />
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb<br />
<br />
Babe<br />
I got you babe<br />
I got you babe<br />
I got you babe<br />
I got you babe<br />
<br />
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. How wonderful you are. God bless you all. Oh, you're a lovely crowd. Thank you, guys. Thank you</p>
