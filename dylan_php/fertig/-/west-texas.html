I'm going down to West Texas<br />
Behind the Louisiana line<br />
I'm going down to West Texas<br />
Behind the Louisiana line<br />
Get me that fortune telling woman<br />
Want to let her gonna read my mind<br />
<br />
If you ever go to Dallas<br />
Take the right hand road<br />
If you ever go to Dallas<br />
Take the right hand road<br />
For wasting down the street boys<br />
Is bound to kill ya for sure<br />
<br />
I'm going down to Jackson River<br />
Past that West Texas line<br />
I'm going down to Jackson River<br />
Behind that West Texas line<br />
If there's a star up above<br />
Lord it's mine, leading my sign<br />
<br>
<br />
Well you never miss your water<br />
Till the well runs dry<br />
And you never miss your water<br />
Till the well runs dry<br />
And you never miss your man<br />
Till he says goodbye<br />
<br />
You can ride and tell my mama<br />
I won't be coming home tonight<br />
You can ride and tell my mother<br />
I won't be home tonight<br />
I'm going down the road boys<br />
I've got to do it right<br />
<br />
I'm going down to West Texas<br />
Behind the Louisiana line<br />
I'm going down to West Texas<br />
Behind the Louisiana line<br />
That fortune telling woman<br />
Won't you let her really read my mind?</p>
