Im a Rambler, I'm a Gambler, I'm a long way from my home<br />
If the people don't like me<br />
they can leave me alone<br />
Come sit down beside me, come sit down right here<br />
Come sit down, long as you want to<br />
Love will always be here<br />
<br />
When we get to Wyoming<br />
the letter you'll see<br />
<br>
If you get in to trouble just you write and tell me<br />
<br />
For I once had a lover, her age was sixteen<br />
Shes the flower of Belton<br />
And the rose of Saline<br />
<br />
Her parents was against me<br />
Now she is the same<br />
If I'm writ on your book, love<br />
Just you blot out my name</p>
