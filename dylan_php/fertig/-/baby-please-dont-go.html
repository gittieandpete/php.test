Baby please don't go<br />
Baby please don't go<br />
Baby please don't go<br />
Back to New Orleans<br />
You know it hurt me so<br />
Baby please don't go<br />
<br />
Turn your lamp down low<br />
Turn your lamp down low<br />
Turn your lamp down low<br />
Don't drive me from your door<br />
Baby please don't go<br />
Baby please don't leave<br />
<br />
<br>
Baby please don't go<br />
Baby please don't go<br />
Baby please don't go<br />
Back to New Orleans<br />
You know it hurt me so<br />
Baby please don't go<br />
<br />
Turn your lamp down low<br />
Turn your lamp down low<br />
Turn your lamp down low<br />
Don't drive me from your door<br />
Baby please don't go<br />
Baby please don't leave<br />
Baby please don't go</p>
