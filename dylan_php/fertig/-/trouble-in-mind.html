I got to know, Lord, when to pull back on the reins<br />
Death can be the result of the most underrated pain<br />
Satan whispers to ya, "Well, I don't want to bore ya<br />
But when ya get tired of the Miss So-and-so I got another woman for ya."<br />
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind<br />
Lord, take away this trouble in mind<br />
When the deeds that you do don't add up to zero<br />
It's what's inside that counts, ask any war hero<br />
You think you can hide but you're never alone<br />
Ask Lot what he thought when his wife turned to stone<br />
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind<br />
Lord, take away this trouble in mind<br />
Here comes Satan, prince of the power of the air<br />
He's gonna make you a law unto yourself, gonna build a bird's nest in your hair<br />
He's gonna deaden your conscience 'til you worship the work of your own hands<br />
You'll be serving strangers in a strange, forsaken land<br />
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind<br />
<br>
Lord, take away this trouble in mind<br />
Well, your true love has caught you where you don't belong<br />
You say, "Baby, everybody's doing it so I guess it can't be wrong."<br />
The truth is far from you, so you know you got to lie<br />
Then you're all the time defending what you can never justify<br />
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind<br />
Lord, take away this trouble in mind<br />
So many of my brothers, they still want to be the boss<br />
They can't relate to the Lord's kingdom, they can't relate to the cross<br />
They self-inflict punishment on their own broken lives<br />
Put their faith in their possessions, in their jobs or their wives<br />
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind<br />
Lord, take away this trouble in mind<br />
When my life is over, it'll be like a puff of smoke<br />
How long must I suffer, Lord, how long must I be provoked?<br />
Satan will give you a little taste, then he'll move in with rapid speed<br />
Lord keep my blind side covered and see that I don't bleed</p>
