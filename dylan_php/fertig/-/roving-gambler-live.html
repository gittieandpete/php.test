I am a rovin' gambler, I've gambled all around<br />
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards<br />
I lay my money down<br />
(I Lay my money down, lay my money down.)<br />
<br />
I gambled up in Washington, gambled over in Spain<br />
I'm on my way to Frisco town<br />
To knock down my last game<br />
(knock down my last game; knock down my last game)<br />
<br />
I had not been in 'Frisco, many more days than three<br />
I fell in love with a pretty little girl<br />
 And she fell in love with me<br />
(Fell in love with me, fell in love with me.)<br />
<br>
<br />
She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with a fan<br />
She whispered low in her mama's ear<br />
"I love this gamblin' man."<br />
("Love this gamelin' man." "Love this gamblin' man.")<br />
<br />
"Daughter, Oh! dear daughter, how could you treat me so?<br />
And leave your dear old mother<br />
And with a gambler go?"<br />
(With a gambler go? with a gambler go?)<br />
<br />
"Mother, Oh dear mother, I'll tell you if I can<br />
If you ever see my face again<br />
I'll be with the gamblin' man"<br />
(be with the gamblin' man" be with the gamblin' man)</p>
