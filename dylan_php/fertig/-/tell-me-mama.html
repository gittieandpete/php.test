Ol' black Bascom, don't break no mirrors<br />
Cold black water dog, make no tears<br />
You say you love me with what may be love<br />
Don't you remember makin' baby love?<br />
Got your steam drill built and you're lookin' for some kid<br />
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did<br />
But I know that you know that I know that you show<br />
Something is tearing up your mind<br />
<br />
Tell me, mama<br />
Tell me, mama<br />
Tell me, mama, what is it?<br />
What's wrong with you this time?<br />
<br />
Hey, John, come and get me some candy goods<br />
Shucks, it sure feels like it's in the woods<br />
Spend some time on your January trips<br />
You got tombstone moose up and your brave-yard whips<br />
If you're anxious to find out when your friendship's gonna end<br />
Come on, baby, I'm your friend!<br />
<br>
And I know that you know that I know that you show<br />
Something is tearing up your mind<br />
<br />
Tell me, mama<br />
Tell me, mama<br />
Tell me, mama, what is it?<br />
What's wrong with you this time?<br />
<br />
Ohh, we bone the editor, can't get read<br />
But his painted sled, instead it's a bed<br />
Yes, I see you on your window ledge<br />
But I can't tell just how far away you are from the edge<br />
And, anyway, you're just gonna make people jump and roar<br />
Whatcha wanna go and do that for?<br />
For I know that you know that I know that you know<br />
Something is tearing up your mind<br />
<br />
Ah, tell me, mama<br />
Tell me, mama<br />
Tell me, mama, what is it?<br />
What's wrong with you this time?</p>
