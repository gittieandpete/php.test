Your breath is sweet<br />
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky<br />
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth<br />
On the pillow where you lie<br />
But I don't sense affection<br />
No gratitude or love<br />
Your loyalty is not to me<br />
But to the stars above<br />
<br />
One more cup of coffee for the road<br />
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go<br />
To the valley below<br />
<br />
Your daddy he's an outlaw<br />
And a wanderer by trade<br />
He'll teach you how to pick and choose<br />
And how to throw the blade<br />
He oversees his kingdom<br />
So no stranger does intrude<br />
<br>
His voice it trembles as he calls out<br />
For another plate of food<br />
<br />
One more cup of coffee for the road<br />
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go<br />
To the valley below<br />
<br />
Your sister sees the future<br />
Like your mama and yourself<br />
You've never learned to read or write<br />
There's no books upon your shelf<br />
And your pleasure knows no limits<br />
Your voice is like a meadowlark<br />
But your heart is like an ocean<br />
Mysterious and dark<br />
<br />
One more cup of coffee for the road<br />
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go<br />
To the valley below</p>
