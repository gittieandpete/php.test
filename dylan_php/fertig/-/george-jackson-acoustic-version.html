I woke up this mornin'<br />
There were tears in my bed<br />
They killed a man I really loved<br />
Shot him through the head<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
They cut George Jackson down<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
They laid him in the ground<br />
<br />
Sent him off to prison<br />
For a seventy-dollar robbery<br />
Closed the door behind him<br />
And they threw away the key<br />
Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
They laid him in the ground<br />
<br />
He wouldn't take shit from no one<br />
He wouldn't bow down or kneel<br />
Authorities, they hated him<br />
Because he was just too real<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
<br>
They cut George Jackson down<br />
<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
They laid him in the ground<br />
<br />
Prison guards, they cursed him<br />
As they watched him from above<br />
But they were frightened of his power<br />
They were scared of his love<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
So they cut George Jackson down<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
They laid him in the ground<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think this whole world<br />
Is one big prison yard<br />
Some of us are prisoners<br />
The rest of us are guards<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
They cut George Jackson down<br />
Lord, Lord<br />
They laid him in the ground</p>
