Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum<br />
Hoist the mainsail – here I come<br />
Ain't no room on board for the insincere<br />
You're my witness<br />
I'm your mutineer<br />
I was born to rock the boat<br />
Some may sink but we will float<br />
Grab your coat – let's get out of here<br />
You're my witness<br />
I'm your mutineer<br />
Long ago we laughed at shadows<br />
Lightning flashed and thunder followed us<br />
It could never find us here<br />
You're my witness<br />
<br>
I'm your mutineer<br />
Long ago we laughed at shadows<br />
Lightning flashed and thunder followed us<br />
It could never find us here<br />
You're my witness<br />
I'm your mutineer<br />
I was born to rock the boat<br />
Some may sink but we will float<br />
Grab your coat – let's get out of here<br />
You're my witness<br />
I'm your mutineer<br />
You're my witness<br />
I'm your mutineer<br />
I'm your mutineer……</p>
