Well it's good morning, good mor..<br />
Well it's good...<br />
<br />
Well it's good morning captain<br />
Good morning son...<br />
<br />
Good morning captain<br />
Good morning son<br />
Good morning captain<br />
Good morning son<br />
You don't need another mule skinner<br />
Out on your new road line<br />
<br />
Yodle-aa-heeee!<br />
Yodle-aa-heeee!<br />
Yodle-aa-heeee!<br />
<br />
I can't do that one<br />
<br />
<br>
Well I like to work<br />
I'm rolling all the time<br />
Well I like to work<br />
I'm rolling all the time<br />
I can pop my initials<br />
Right on the mules behind<br />
<br />
Well it's hey little waterboy<br />
Bring your water round<br />
Well it's hey little waterboy<br />
Bring your water round<br />
If you don't like your job<br />
Set that waterbucket down<br />
<br />
I'm a-working on the new road<br />
At a dollar and a dime a day<br />
I'm a-working on the new road<br />
At a dollar and a dime a day<br />
I got three women waiting on a saturday night<br />
Just to draw my pay</p>
