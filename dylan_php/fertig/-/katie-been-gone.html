Katie's been gone since the spring time<br />
She wrote one time'n sent her love<br />
Katie's been gone for such a long time now<br />
I wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of<br />
Dear Katie<br />
If you can hear me<br />
I can't wait to have ya near me<br />
Oh, Katie, since ya caught that bus<br />
Well, I just don't know how things are with us<br />
I'm still here and you're out there<br />
Katie laughed when I said I was lonely<br />
She said, there's no need t'feel that way<br />
Katie said that I was her only one<br />
But then I wonder why she didn't want to stay<br />
Dear Katie, if I'm the only one<br />
How much longer will you be gone?<br />
Oh, Katie, won't ya tell me straight:<br />
How much longer do I have to wait?<br />
<br>
I'll believe you<br />
But please come through<br />
I know it's wrong to be apart this long<br />
You should be here, near me<br />
Katie's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind<br />
She's gone to find some newer places<br />
Left the old life far behind<br />
Dear Katie, don't ya miss your home?<br />
I don't see why you had to roam<br />
Dear Katie, since you've been away<br />
I lose a little something every day<br />
I need you here, but you're still out there<br />
Dear Katie, please drop me a line<br />
Just write, love, to tell me you're fine<br />
Oh, Katie, if you can hear me<br />
I just can't wait to have you near me<br />
I can only think<br />
Where are you<br />
What ya do, may be there's someone new</p>
