[Verse]<br />
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland<br />
And the bankers are taking my home and my land from me<br />
There's a big aching hole in my chest now where my heart was<br />
And a hole in the sky where God used to be<br />
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland<br />
There's a well where the water's so bitter nobody can drink<br />
Ain't no way to get high and my mouth is so dry that I can't speak<br />
Don't they know that I'm dying why's nobody crying for me<br />
<br>
My American dream fell apart at the seams<br />
You tell me what it means you tell me what it means<br />
There's a home place under fire tonight in a heartland<br />
And bankers are taking the homes and the land away<br />
There's a young boy closing his eyes tonight in a heartland<br />
Who will wake up a man with some land and a loan he can't pay<br />
His American dream fell apart at the seams<br />
You tell me what it means you tell me what it means<br />
My American dream<br />
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland [x4]</p>
