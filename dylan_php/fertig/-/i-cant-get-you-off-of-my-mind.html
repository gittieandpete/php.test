Oh, I can't get you off of my mind<br />
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time<br />
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried<br />
But I can't get you off of my mind<br />
<br />
And you think you would leave me behind<br />
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind<br />
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart<br />
When I can't get you off of my mind?<br />
<br />
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind<br />
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time<br />
<br>
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried<br />
But I can't get you off of my mind<br />
<br />
You believe that a true love is blind<br />
So you fool every new love you find<br />
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies<br />
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind<br />
<br />
But I can't get you off of my mind<br />
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time<br />
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried<br />
But I can't get you off of my mind</p>
