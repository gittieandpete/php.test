I was born in '63<br />
Got a little job in the factory<br />
I don't know much about Kennedy<br />
I was too busy working in the factory<br />
<br />
We got a kid that's two, we got another one due<br />
We get by the best we can do<br />
The factory's got a good medical plan<br />
And, cousin, I'm a union man<br />
Saying, Yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir - Work!<br />
<br />
I was born in Mechanicsburg<br />
My daddy worked for Pontiac 'til he got hurt<br />
Now he's on disability<br />
<br>
And I got his old job in the factory<br />
Saying, Yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir - Work!<br />
<br />
Early in the morning I feel a chill<br />
The factory whistle blows loud and shrill<br />
I'd kill my wife or she'd kill me<br />
But we gotta go to work in the factory<br />
Six days a week at the factory<br />
Up early in the morning at the factory<br />
I've been working in the factory<br />
Johnny, I've been working in the factory<br />
Kickin' asbestos in the factory<br />
Punchin' out Chryslers in the factory<br />
Breathin' that plastic in the factory<br />
Makin' polyvinyl chloride in the factory</p>
