Cane standing in the fields getting old and red<br />
Lot of misery in Georgetown, three men lying dead<br />
And Joshua, head of the government, say strike for better pay<br />
Cane cutters are striking, Joshua gone away<br />
Joshua gone Barbados, just like he don't know<br />
People on this Island, they got nowhere to go<br />
<br />
(??) in the city, you can hear how the women bawl<br />
<br>
Joshua gone Barbados, he don't care at all<br />
<br />
Sonny Child the overseer, I swear he's an ignorant man<br />
Walking through the canefield, pistol in his hand<br />
(??)<br />
(??) strike be all in vain<br />
Joshua gone Barbados, just like he don't know<br />
People on the St. Vincent, they got no place to go</p>
