Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night<br />
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall<br />
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood<br />
Cries out, "My God, they've killed them all!"<br />
Here comes the story of the Hurricane<br />
The man the authorities came to blame<br />
For somethin' that he never done<br />
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br />
The champion of the world<br />
<br />
Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see<br />
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously<br />
"I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands<br />
"I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand<br />
I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops<br />
"One of us had better call up the cops."<br />
And so Patty calls the cops<br />
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'<br />
In the hot New Jersey night<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town<br />
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around<br />
Number one contender for the middleweight crown<br />
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down<br />
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road<br />
Just like the time before and the time before that<br />
In Paterson that's just the way things go<br />
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street<br />
'Less you wanna draw the heat<br />
<br />
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops<br />
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around<br />
He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights<br />
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."<br />
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head<br />
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"<br />
So they took him to the infirmary<br />
And though this man could hardly see<br />
They told him that he could identify the guilty men<br />
<br />
Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in<br />
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs<br />
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye<br />
Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!"<br />
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane<br />
The man the authorities came to blame<br />
For somethin' that he never done<br />
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br />
The champion of the world<br />
<br />
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame<br />
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name<br />
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game<br />
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame<br />
<br>
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?<br />
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?<br />
You think you'd like to play ball with the law?<br />
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?<br />
Don't forget that you are white."<br />
<br />
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."<br />
Cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break<br />
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello<br />
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow<br />
You'll be doin' society a favor<br />
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver<br />
We want to put his ass in stir<br />
We want to pin this triple murder on him<br />
He ain't no Gentleman Jim."<br />
<br />
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch<br />
But he never did like to talk about it all that much<br />
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay<br />
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way<br />
Up to some paradise<br />
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice<br />
And ride a horse along a trail<br />
But then they took him to the jail house<br />
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse<br />
<br />
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance<br />
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance<br />
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums<br />
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum<br />
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga<br />
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger<br />
And though they could not produce the gun<br />
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed<br />
And the all-white jury agreed<br />
<br />
Rubin Carter was falsely tried<br />
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?<br />
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied<br />
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride<br />
How can the life of such a man<br />
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?<br />
To see him obviously framed<br />
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land<br />
Where justice is a game<br />
<br />
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties<br />
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise<br />
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell<br />
An innocent man in a living hell<br />
Yes, that's the story of the Hurricane<br />
But it won't be over till they clear his name<br />
And give him back the time he's done<br />
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br />
The champion of the world</p>
