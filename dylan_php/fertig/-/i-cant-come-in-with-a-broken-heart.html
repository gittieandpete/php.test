Well i go get broke down, before i bust down<br />
Gotta get in without a broken heart well<br />
Get a hoe down before a low down<br />
Before my guilt is acid hot<br />
Well every single morning<br />
I can't take it no more<br />
Well if you with a heartache<br />
Go down baby<br />
<br>
She don't care about that us apart<br />
Well she gonna have 'em, but she won't invite me<br />
But i can't come in with a broken heart<br />
I hold down, can't come down<br />
Is comin' in without a broken heart<br />
Well you cheated, showed her down<br />
But i don't come around<br />
O when she'll take ya tear us apart</p>
