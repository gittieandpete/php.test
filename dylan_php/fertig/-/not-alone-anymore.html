You always said that I'd be back again<br />
That I'd come running to you in the end<br />
I thought that you were on your own<br />
And now I find you're not alone<br />
<br />
(Not alone) I'll see you through the rain<br />
(Not alone) Through the heartache and pain<br />
(Not alone) It hurts like never before<br />
You're not alone anymore<br />
<br />
You always said that I would know someday<br />
Just how it feels when your love walks away<br />
I let you down, I let you go<br />
I lost you how was I to know?<br />
<br />
(Not alone) I'll see you through the rain<br />
<br>
(Not alone) Through the heartache and pain<br />
(Not alone) It hurts like never before<br />
You're not alone anymore<br />
<br />
I never knew I could feel this way<br />
I never could see past yesterday<br />
You feel that everything is gone<br />
I feel it too, you're not alone<br />
<br />
(Not alone) I'll see you through the rain<br />
(Not alone) Every heartache and pain<br />
(Not alone) It hurts like never before<br />
<br />
You're not alone, you're not alone<br />
You're not alone anymore<br />
Anymore<br />
Anymore</p>
