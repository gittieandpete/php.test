By Bob Dylan<br />
<br />
Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring<br />
The trucks and the trailers will be winding<br />
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route<br />
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun<br />
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling<br />
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands<br />
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen<br />
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling<br />
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana<br />
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels<br />
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing<br />
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright<br />
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend<br />
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers<br />
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind<br />
Following them fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents<br />
<br>
Get that canvas flag a-flying<br />
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind<br />
Following them fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds<br />
Just behind the posters that are hanging<br />
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face<br />
Following them fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind<br />
Hear that old music box a-banging<br />
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles<br />
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town<br />
Hit the old highway by the morning<br />
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time<br />
Following them fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime<br />
Drinking red wine as we're rolling<br />
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn<br />
From following them fairgrounds a-calling<br />
<br />
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg<br />
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em<br />
And the money that we made will pay for the space<br />
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling</p>
