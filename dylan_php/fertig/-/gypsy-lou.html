[Verse 1]<br />
If you getcha one girl, better get two<br />
Case you run into Gypsy Lou<br />
She's a rambling' woman with a Ramblin' mind<br />
Always leaving' somebody behind<br />
Hey, 'round the bend<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Well, I seen the whole country through<br />
Just to find Gypsy Lou<br />
Seen it up, seen it down<br />
Following' Gypsy Lou around<br />
Hey, 'round the bend<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Well, I gotta stop and take some rest<br />
My poor feet are second best<br />
My poor feet are wearing' thin<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
Hey, gone again<br />
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend<br />
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Well, seen her up in old Cheyenne<br />
Turned my head and away she ran<br />
From Denver Town to Wichita<br />
Last I heard she's in Arkansas<br />
Hey, 'round the bend<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Well, I tell you what if you want to do<br />
Tell you what, you'll wear out your shoes<br />
If you want to wear out your shoes<br />
Try and follow Gypsy Lou<br />
Hey, gone again<br />
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend<br />
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
Well, Gypsy Lou, I been told<br />
Living' down on Gallus Road<br />
Gallus Road, Arlington<br />
Moved away to Washington<br />
Hey, 'round the bend<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
Well, I went down to Washington<br />
Then she went to Oregon<br />
I skipped the ground and hopped a train<br />
She's back in Gallus Road again<br />
Hey, I can't win<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
<br />
[Verse 8]<br />
Well, the last I heard of Gypsy Lou<br />
She's in a Memphis calaboose<br />
She left one too many a boy behind<br />
He committed suicide<br />
Hey, you can't win<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again<br />
Gypsy Lou's gone again</p>
