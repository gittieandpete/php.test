There was a little boy and there was a little girl<br />
And they lived in an alley under the red sky<br />
There was a little boy and there was a little girl<br />
And they lived in an alley under the red sky<br />
There was an old man and he lived in the moon<br />
One summer's day he came passing by<br />
There was an old man and he lived in the moon<br />
And one day he came passing by<br />
Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new<br />
Someday little girl, you'll have a diamond as big as your shoe<br />
<br>
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high<br />
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie<br />
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high<br />
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie<br />
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town<br />
This is the blind horse that leads you around<br />
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly<br />
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry<br />
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly<br />
The man in the moon went home and the river went dry</p>
