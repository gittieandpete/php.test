It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe<br />
If you don't know by now<br />
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe<br />
It'll never do somehow<br />
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn<br />
Look out your window and I'll be gone<br />
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on<br />
Don't think twice, it's all right<br />
<br />
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe<br />
That light I never knowed<br />
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe<br />
I'm on the dark side of the road<br />
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say<br />
To try and make me change my mind and stay<br />
We never did too much talkin' anyway<br />
So don't think twice, it's all right<br />
<br>
<br />
So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal<br />
Like you never done before<br />
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal<br />
I can't hear you any more<br />
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walking down the road<br />
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told<br />
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul<br />
But don't think twice, it's all right<br />
<br />
So long, honey baby<br />
Where I'm bound, I can't tell<br />
But goodbye's too good a word, babe<br />
So I'll just say fare thee well<br />
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind<br />
You could have done better but I don't mind<br />
You just kinda wasted my precious time<br />
But don't think twice, it's all right</p>
