'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood<br />
When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud<br />
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured<br />
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word<br />
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved<br />
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved<br />
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail<br />
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail<br />
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there<br />
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair<br />
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
<br>
Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost<br />
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed<br />
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount<br />
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts<br />
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove<br />
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love<br />
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes<br />
I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose<br />
I offered up my innocence I got repaid with scorn<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm<br />
Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line<br />
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine<br />
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born<br />
Come in, she said<br />
I'll give ya shelter from the storm</p>
