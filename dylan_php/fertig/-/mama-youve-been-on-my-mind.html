[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]<br />
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror<br />
I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near<br />
I'd be curious to know if your reflection is as clear<br />
As the one that I've got on my mind, mama, you been on my mind<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Well perhaps it's the wind and the dark dark night that's covering<br />
The crossroads that I'm at<br />
And maybe it's the weather or something like that<br />
But mama, you been on my mind, mama, you been on my mind<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Well I don't need trouble, please don't put me down<br />
Don't get upset, I am not pleading, I won't say I'll forget<br />
And I won't pace a floor bowed down and bent but yet<br />
Mama, you been on my mind, mama, you been on my mind<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts are kinda narrow<br />
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow<br />
It don't matter to me where you'll be waking up tomorrow<br />
But mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind</p>
