How many times have you heard someone say<br />
"If I had his money, I could do things my way"<br />
But little they know that it's so hard to find<br />
One rich man in Ten with a satisfied mind<br />
<br />
Once I was winning in fortune and fame;<br />
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game<br />
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime<br />
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind<br />
<br>
<br />
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old<br />
Or a friend when you're lonesome or a love that's grown cold<br />
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times<br />
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind<br />
<br />
When life is over, my time has run out<br />
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt<br />
But one thing for certain, when it comes my time<br />
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind</p>
