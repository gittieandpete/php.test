Well the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell.<br />
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well.<br />
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land.<br />
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam.<br />
<br />
She come up the Canadian Rockies where the crystal waters glide,<br />
Comes a-roaring down the canyon to meet that salty tide<br />
From the great Pacific Ocean to where the sun sets in the west,<br />
That big Grand Coulee country in that land I love the best.<br />
<br />
In the misty glitter of that wild and windward spray,<br />
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave.<br />
Once she tore men's boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream,<br />
That day that Grand Coulee dam went across that wild and restless stream.<br />
<br>
<br />
Oh Uncle Sam took up the notion in the year of thirty three,<br />
For the factory and the farmer and for all of you and me.<br />
He said: roll it on Columbia, you can roll out to the sea<br />
But river, while you're rolling you can do some work for me.<br />
<br />
Now from Washington and Oregon you can hear them factories a-hum,<br />
Making corn and making manganese and light aluminum.<br />
Always a flying fortress to blast for Uncle Sam,<br />
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee dam.<br />
<br />
Well the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell.<br />
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well.<br />
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land.<br />
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam</p>
