Well she met him as she promised<br />
Up at Adam's this spring<br />
Expecting some money<br />
Or some other fine thing<br />
No money, no money<br />
To flatter the case<br />
"We'll have to get married<br />
So there'll be no disgrace."<br />
"So jump you up Omie<br />
And away we will ride<br />
To yonder fair country<br />
Where the cool waters glide."<br />
She jumped up behind him<br />
And away they did ride<br />
To yonder fair country<br />
Where the deep waters glide<br />
"Now jump you down Omie<br />
And i'll tell you my mind<br />
My mind is to drown you<br />
And to leave you behind."<br />
She begged and she pleaded<br />
"Oh, don't take my life<br />
<br>
And i will deny you<br />
And i'll never be your wife."<br />
There she kicked and he cuffed her<br />
To the worst understand<br />
And he threw her in deep water<br />
That flows through the land<br />
They found her poor body<br />
The following day<br />
The preacher and the reverend<br />
Lord, they all begun to pray<br />
And up spoke her mother<br />
With a voice so a-sting<br />
"Nobody but John Lewis<br />
Could've done such a thing."<br />
They traced him up the waters<br />
To Dutch Charlie's Bend<br />
Where they found him in jail<br />
For killin' a man<br />
"Go hang him, go hang him."<br />
Was that mother's command<br />
"And throw him in deep waters<br />
That flows through the land."</p>
