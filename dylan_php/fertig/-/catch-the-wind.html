In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty, <br />
I want to be in the warm heart of your loving mind. <br />
To feel you all around me, <br />
And to take your hand along the sand, <br />
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind. <br />
<br />
When sundown pales the sky, <br />
I want to hide a while behind your smile, <br />
And everywhere I look your eyes I find. <br />
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing, <br />
<br>
T'would make me sing, <br />
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind. <br />
<br />
When rain has hung the leaves with tears, <br />
I want you near, to kill my fears, <br />
To help me to leave all my blues behind. <br />
Standing in your heart is where I want to be <br />
And long to be, <br />
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind. <br />
<br />
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.</p>
