[Verse 1]<br />
Well, I ain't got my childhood<br />
Or friends I once did know<br />
No, I ain't got my childhood<br />
Or friends I once did know<br />
But I still got my voice left<br />
I can take it anywhere I go<br />
Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doing fine<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
And I've never had much money<br />
But I'm still around somehow<br />
No, I've never had much money<br />
But I'm still around somehow<br />
Many times I've bended<br />
But I ain't never yet bowed<br />
Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doing fine<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Trouble, oh trouble<br />
I've trouble on my mind<br />
Trouble, oh trouble<br />
Trouble on my mind<br />
But the trouble in the world, Lord<br />
Is much more bigger than mine<br />
Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doing fine<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
And I never had no armies<br />
To jump at my command<br />
No, I ain't got no armies<br />
To jump at my command<br />
But I don't need no armies<br />
I got me one good friend<br />
Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doing fine<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on<br />
I been shot at just like you<br />
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on<br />
I been shot at just like you<br />
But as long as the world keeps a-turning<br />
I just keep a-turnin' too<br />
Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doing' fine<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
Well, my road might be rocky<br />
The stones might cut my face<br />
My road it might be rocky<br />
The stones might cut my face<br />
But as some folks ain't got no road at all<br />
They gotta stand in the same old place<br />
Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doing fine</p>
