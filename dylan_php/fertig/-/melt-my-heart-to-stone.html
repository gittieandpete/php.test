[Verse 1]<br />
Right under my feet is air made of bricks<br />
Pulls me down turns me weak for you<br />
I find myself repeating like a broken tune<br />
And I'm forever excusing your intentions<br />
And I give in to my pretending's<br />
Which forgive you each time<br />
Without me knowing, they melt my heart to stone<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
And I hear your words that I made up<br />
You say my name like there could be an us<br />
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love<br />
I'm the only one in love<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Each and every time I turn around to leave<br />
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed<br />
So desperately I try to link it with my head<br />
But instead I fall back to my knees<br />
<br>
As you tear your way right through me<br />
I forgive you once again<br />
Without me knowing, you've burnt my heart to stone<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
And I hear your words that I made up<br />
You say my name like there could be an us<br />
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love<br />
I'm the only one in love<br />
<br />
[Bridge]<br />
Why do you steal my hand<br />
Whenever I'm standing my own ground<br />
You build me up, then leave me there<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Well I hear your words you made up<br />
So I say your name like there should be an us<br />
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one<br />
In love, I'm the only one in love</p>
