I'm ol' Tom Moore from the bummers' shore<br />
In the the good ol' golden days<br />
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too<br />
But what cares I for praise<br />
I wander round from town to town<br />
Just like a rovin' sign<br />
And all the people say<br />
There goes Tom Moore in the days of '49<br />
<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How often times I repine<br />
For the days of old when we dug up the gold<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
My comrades they all loved me well<br />
A jolly saucy crew<br />
A few hard cases I will recall<br />
Though they all were brave and true<br />
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch<br />
They never would fret or whine<br />
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How oftimes I repine<br />
For the days of old when we dug up the gold<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
There was New York Jake the butcher's boy<br />
He was always gettin' tight<br />
And every time that he'd got booked<br />
He was spoiling for a fight<br />
That Jake rampaged against a knife<br />
In the hands of ol' Bob Stein<br />
An' over Jake they held a wake<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How often times I repine<br />
For the days of old when we dug up the gold<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
There was Poker Bill one of the boys<br />
<br>
Who was always in a game<br />
Whether he lost or whether he won<br />
To him it was always the same<br />
He would ante up and draw his cards<br />
And he would you go a hatful blind<br />
In a game with death, Bill lost his breath<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
In the days times I repine<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
Those were days of '49<br />
<br />
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo<br />
I never will forget<br />
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night<br />
And I guess he's roarin' yet<br />
One day he fell in a prospect hole<br />
In a roarin' bad design<br />
And in that hole he roared out his soul<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How oftimes I repine<br />
For the days of old when we dug up the gold<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
Of the comrades all that I've had<br />
There's none that's left to boast<br />
And I'm left alone in my misery<br />
Like some ol' poor wanderin' ghost<br />
And I pass by from town to town<br />
They call me the ramblin' sign<br />
There goes Tom Moore, a-bummer's shore<br />
In the days of '49<br />
<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How often times I repine<br />
For the days of old when we dug up the gold<br />
In the days of '49<br />
In the days of old when we dug up the gold<br />
How oftimes I repine<br />
For the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
In the days of '49</p>
