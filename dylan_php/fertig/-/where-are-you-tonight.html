There's a long-distance train rolling through the rain<br />
Tears on the letter I write<br />
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missin' her so much<br />
But she's drifting like a satellite<br />
<br />
There's a neon light ablaze in a green smoky haze<br />
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street<br />
There's a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone<br />
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat<br />
<br />
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise<br />
But he practiced what he preached from the heart<br />
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me<br />
The time and the place that we'd part<br />
<br />
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage<br />
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage<br />
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page<br />
Of a book that nobody can write<br />
Oh, where are you tonight?<br />
<br />
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure<br />
To live it you had to explode<br />
In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed<br />
Sacrifice was the code of the road<br />
<br />
I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John<br />
Strong men belittled by doubt<br />
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were<br />
But she had some way of finding them out<br />
<br />
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same<br />
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf<br />
<br>
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair<br />
And discovered her invisible self<br />
<br />
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped<br />
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped<br />
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape<br />
Well I won't, but then maybe again, I might<br />
Oh, if I could just find you tonight<br />
<br />
I fought with my twin, that enemy within<br />
Till both of us fell by the way<br />
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees<br />
While the law looks the other way<br />
<br />
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes<br />
The man you were lovin' could never get clean<br />
It felt out of place, my foot in his face<br />
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green<br />
<br />
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit<br />
With the juice running down my leg<br />
Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss<br />
Who always was too proud to beg<br />
<br />
There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room<br />
And a pathway that leads up to the stars<br />
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise<br />
Just remind me to show you the scars<br />
<br />
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived<br />
If I'm-a there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived<br />
I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive<br />
But without you it doesn't seem right<br />
Oh, where are you tonight?</p>
