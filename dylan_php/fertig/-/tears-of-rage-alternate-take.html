We carried you in our arms<br />
On Independence Day<br />
And now you'll throw us all aside<br />
And put us all away<br />
Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun<br />
Could treat a father so?<br />
To wait upon him hand and foot<br />
Yet always answer, "No"<br />
Tears of rage, tears of grief<br />
Why must I always be the thief?<br />
Come to me now, you know we're so low<br />
And life is brief<br />
It was all so very painless<br />
When you ran out to receive<br />
All that false instruction<br />
Which we never could believe<br />
And now the heart is filled with gold<br />
As if it was a purse<br />
<br>
But, oh, what kind of love is this<br />
Which goes from bad to worse?<br />
Tears of rage, tears of grief<br />
Why must I always be the thief?<br />
Come to me now, you know we're so low<br />
And life is brief<br />
We pointed you the way to go<br />
And scratched your name in sand<br />
Though you thought it was nothing more<br />
Than a place for you to stand<br />
I want you to know that while we watched<br />
You discovered that no one would be true<br />
That I myself was among the ones who thought<br />
It was just a childish thing to do<br />
Tears of rage, tears of grief<br />
Why must I always be the thief?<br />
Come to me now, you know we're so low<br />
And life is brief</p>
