You say you love me<br />
And you're thinkin' of me<br />
But you know you could be wrong<br />
You say you told me<br />
That you wanna hold me<br />
But you know you're not that strong<br />
I just can't do what I done before<br />
I just can't beg you any more<br />
I'm gonna let you pass<br />
And I'll go last<br />
Then time will tell just who fell<br />
And who's been left behind<br />
When you go your way and I go mine<br />
<br />
You say you disturb me<br />
And you don't deserve me<br />
But you know sometimes you lie<br />
You say you're shakin'<br />
And you're always achin'<br />
But you know how hard you try<br />
Sometimes it gets so hard to care<br />
It can't be this way ev'rywhere<br />
And I'm gonna let you pass<br />
<br>
Yes, and I'll go last<br />
Then time will tell just who fell<br />
And who's been left behind<br />
When you go your way and I go mine<br />
<br />
The judge, he holds a grudge<br />
He's gonna call on you<br />
But he's badly built<br />
And he walks on stilts<br />
Watch out he don't fall on you<br />
<br />
You say you're sorry<br />
For tellin' stories<br />
That you know I believe are true<br />
You say ya got some<br />
Other kinda lover<br />
And yes, I believe you do<br />
You say my kisses are not like his<br />
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is<br />
I'm just gonna let you pass<br />
Yes, and I'll go last<br />
Then time will tell who fell<br />
And who's been left behind<br />
When you go your way and I go mine</p>
