Sylvie is a good old girl, from Florida so they say<br />
She came up here last April to pass some time away<br />
<br />
Now won't you bring me a little water, Sylvie?<br />
Bring me a little water now?<br />
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?<br />
For my tired brow<br />
<br />
Sylvie came here Wednesday<br />
She came this morning by the light of the dawn<br />
She comes up here now nearly all of the time<br />
To see if she can carry on<br />
<br />
Now won't you bring me a little water, Sylvie?<br />
Bring me a little water now?<br />
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?<br />
For my tired brow<br />
<br />
Sylvie says she loves me<br />
<br>
She says it all of the time<br />
She always gets behind me<br />
When the hill is too high to climb<br />
<br />
Now bring me a little water, Sylvie?<br />
Bring me a little water now?<br />
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?<br />
For my tired brow<br />
<br />
She brings beer and honey<br />
Brings me slop and beans<br />
Brings me coconuts and candy<br />
Brings me turnip greens<br />
<br />
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?<br />
Bring me a little water now?<br />
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?<br />
For my tired brow<br />
For my tired brow<br />
Oh, for my tired brow</p>
