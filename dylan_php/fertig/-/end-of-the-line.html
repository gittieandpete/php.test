[Chorus 1: George Harrison]<br />
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze<br />
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please<br />
Well it's all right, doing the best you can<br />
Well it's all right, as long as you lend a hand<br />
<br />
[Verse 1: Tom Petty]<br />
You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring<br />
Waiting for someone to tell you everything<br />
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring<br />
Maybe a diamond ring<br />
<br />
[Chorus 2: Jeff Lynne]<br />
Well it's all right, even if they say you're wrong<br />
Well it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong<br />
Well it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay<br />
Well it's all right, everyday is Judgement Day<br />
<br />
[Verse 2: Tom Petty]<br />
Maybe somewhere down the road away<br />
You'll think of me, and wonder where I am these days<br />
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays<br />
Purple haze<br />
<br />
<br>
[Chorus 3: Roy Orbison]<br />
Well it's all right, even when push comes to shove<br />
Well it's all right, if you got someone to love<br />
Well it's all right, everything'll work out fine<br />
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line<br />
<br />
[Verse 3: Tom Petty]<br />
Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive<br />
I'm just glad to be here, happy to be alive<br />
It don't matter if you're by my side<br />
I'm satisfied<br />
<br />
[Chorus 4: George Harrison]<br />
Well it's all right, even if you're old and grey<br />
Well it's all right, you still got something to say<br />
<br />
[Jeff Lynne]<br />
Well it's all right, remember to live and let live<br />
Well it's all right, the best you can do is forgive<br />
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze<br />
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please<br />
<br />
[George Harrison]<br />
Well it's all right, even if the sun don't shine<br />
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line</p>
