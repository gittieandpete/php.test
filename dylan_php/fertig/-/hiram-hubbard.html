Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty<br />
I've heard a great many say<br />
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty<br />
I've heard a great many say<br />
He was not in this county<br />
He was forty miles away<br />
<br />
But they took him 'cross the mountain<br />
And they whomped him on the hill<br />
Yes, they took him on the mountain<br />
And they whomped him on the hill<br />
It was there that he pleaded<br />
Oh, please, let me make my will<br />
<br />
But Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty<br />
I've heard a great many say<br />
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty<br />
I've heard a great many say<br />
He was not in this county<br />
He was forty miles away<br />
<br />
But they took him down to Danville<br />
And they throwed him in jail<br />
Yes, they took him down to Danville<br />
<br>
And they throwed him in jail<br />
And it was then nobody sought him<br />
Nobody could go his bail<br />
<br />
But Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty<br />
I've heard a great many say<br />
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty<br />
I've heard a great many say<br />
He was not in this county<br />
He was forty miles away<br />
<br />
But they took him out at midnight<br />
And they strapped him to a tree<br />
Yes, they took him out at midnight<br />
And they strapped him to a tree<br />
It was there that they killed him<br />
With rifle bullets three<br />
<br />
But Hiram Hubbard was not guilty<br />
Lord, I heard a great many say<br />
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty<br />
I heard a great many say<br />
He was not in this county<br />
He was forty miles away</p>
