Well I woke up this morning looked all around<br />
See my milkcow but she can't be found<br />
Halla pleease, pleease don't do me wrong don't do me wrong<br />
If you see my milkcow Lord Lord send her home<br />
<br />
Well I woke up this morning looked around my bed<br />
Couldn't even eat my breakfast blues in my bread<br />
Halla pleease, pleease don't do me wrong don't do me wrong<br />
If you see my milkcow Lord Lord send her home<br />
<br>
<br />
Well ma your calf is hungry I believe she needs a suck<br />
But your milk is turning blue I believe she's out of luck<br />
Halla pleease, pleease don't do me wrong don't do me wrong<br />
If you see my milkcow Lord God send her home<br />
<br />
Well since my milkcow left me I've been treated wrong<br />
I ain't had no milk and butter since my cow been gone<br />
Halla pleease, pleease don't do me wrong don't do me wrong<br />
If you see my milkcow Lord God send her home</p>
