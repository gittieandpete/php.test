Well, early in the morning to late at night<br />
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright<br />
I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too<br />
<br />
Well, the hobo got too high and he came to me naturally<br />
He stole my baby, then he wanted to steal me<br />
I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too<br />
<br />
 Won't you come with me, baby, I'll take you where you wanna go<br />
And if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know<br />
<br>
I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too<br />
<br />
Well, the room is so stuffy I can hardly breathe<br />
Everybody's gone but me and you, and I can't be the last to leave<br />
I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too<br />
<br />
Well, they sent for the ambulance, then one was sent<br />
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident<br />
I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too</p>
