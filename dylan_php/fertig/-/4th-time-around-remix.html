When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf<br />
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes, and said, "What else you got left?"<br />
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget<br />
Everybody must give something back for something they get"<br />
<br />
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come<br />
And she buttoned her boot, and straightened her suit, and she said, "Don't get cute"<br />
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs<br />
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum<br />
<br />
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked<br />
And after finding out I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked<br />
<br>
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense<br />
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against<br />
<br />
Her Jamaica rum, and when she did come, I asked her for some<br />
She said, "No, dear," I said, "Your words aren't clear, you'd better spit out your gum"<br />
She screamed 'til her face got so red, then she fell on the floor<br />
And I covered up and then thought I'd go look through her drawer<br />
<br />
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you<br />
And you, you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time<br />
And I, I never took much, I never asked for your crutch<br />
Now don't ask for mine</p>
