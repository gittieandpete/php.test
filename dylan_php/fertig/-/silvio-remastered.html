Stake my future on a hell of a past<br />
Looks like tomorrow is a coming on fast<br />
Ain't complaining about what I got<br />
Seen better times but who has not<br />
<br />
Silvio silver and gold<br />
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold<br />
Silvio I gotta go<br />
Find out something only dead men know<br />
<br />
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone<br />
When I come a-knockin' don't throw me no bone<br />
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home<br />
If you don't like it you can leave me alone<br />
<br />
I can snap my fingers and require the rain<br />
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again<br />
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain<br />
And charm the whistle off an evening train<br />
<br />
Silvio silver and gold<br />
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold<br />
Silvio I gotta go<br />
Find out something only dead men know<br />
<br />
Give what I got until I got no more<br />
I take what I get until I even the score<br />
You know I love you and further more<br />
When it is time to go you got an open door<br />
<br>
<br />
I can tell your fancy I can tell your plain<br />
You give something up for everything you gain<br />
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain<br />
Pay for your ticket and don't complain<br />
<br />
Silvio silver and gold<br />
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold<br />
Silvio I gotta go<br />
Find out something only dead men know<br />
<br />
One of these days and it won't be long<br />
Going down in the valley and sing my song<br />
I will sing it loud and sing it strong<br />
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong<br />
<br />
Silvio silver and gold<br />
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold<br />
Silvio I gotta go<br />
Find out something only dead men know<br />
<br />
Silvio silver and gold<br />
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold<br />
Silvio I gotta go<br />
Find out something only dead men know<br />
<br />
Silvio silver and gold<br />
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold<br />
Silvio I gotta go<br />
Find out something only dead men know</p>
