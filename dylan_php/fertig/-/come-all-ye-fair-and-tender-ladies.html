Come all ye fair and tender ladies<br />
Be careful how you court young men<br />
They're like a star on a summer's morning<br />
They'll first appear and then they're gone<br />
<br />
They'll tell you some loving story<br />
They'll declare to you their love is true<br />
Then they will go and court some other<br />
And that's the love they have for you<br />
<br />
Do you remember our days of courting<br />
When your head lay upon my breast<br />
You could make me believe with falling of your arm<br />
That the sun rose in the West<br />
<br>
<br />
I wish I was a little sparrow<br />
And I had wings with which to fly<br />
Right over to see my false true-lover<br />
And when he's talking I'd be nigh<br />
<br />
But I'm not a little sparrow<br />
I have no wings with which to fly<br />
So I sit here in grief and sorrow<br />
To weep and pass my troubles by<br />
<br />
If I had known before I courted<br />
That love was such a killing thing<br />
I'd a-locked my heart in a box of golden<br />
And fastened it up with a silver pin</p>
