Well my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair<br />
Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air<br />
Bluebelles blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow<br />
Well my heart's in the Highland<br />
I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go<br />
<br />
Windows were shakin' all night in my dreams<br />
Everything was exactly the way that it seems<br />
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page<br />
Same ol' rat race<br />
Life in the same ol' cage<br />
<br />
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take<br />
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake<br />
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery<br />
I wish someone would come<br />
And push back the clock for me<br />
<br />
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam<br />
That's where I'll be when I get called home<br />
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme<br />
Well my heart's in the Highland<br />
I can only get there one step at a time<br />
<br />
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound<br />
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"<br />
Feel like I'm drifting<br />
Drifting from scene the scene<br />
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?<br />
<br />
Insanity is smashing up against my soul<br />
You can say I was on anything but a roll<br />
If I had a conscience, well I just might blow my top<br />
What would I do with it anyway?<br />
Maybe take it to the pawn shop<br />
<br />
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn<br />
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan<br />
Big white clouds, like chariots that swing down low<br />
Well my heart's in the Highlands<br />
Only place left to go<br />
<br />
I'm in Boston town, in some restaurant<br />
I got no idea what I want<br />
Well, maybe I do but I'm just really not sure<br />
Waitress comes over<br />
Nobody in the place but me and her<br />
<br />
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around<br />
She studies me closely as I sit down<br />
She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs<br />
I say, "Tell me what I want."<br />
She say, "You probably want hard boiled eggs."<br />
<br />
I said, "That's right, bring me some."<br />
She says, "We ain't got any. You picked the wrong time to come"<br />
Then she says, "I know you're an artist, draw a picture of me!"<br />
I say, "I would if I could, but<br />
I don't do sketches from memory."<br />
<br>
<br />
"Well," she says, "I'm right here in front of you or haven't you looked?"<br />
I say, "All right, I know, but I don't have my drawing book!"<br />
She gives me a napkin, she says, "You can do it on that."<br />
I say, "Yes I could but<br />
I don't know where my pencil is at!"<br />
<br />
She pulls one out from behind her ear<br />
She says, "All right now, go ahead, draw me, I'm standing right here."<br />
I make a few lines, and I show it for her to see<br />
Well she takes a napkin and throws it back<br />
And says, "That don't look a thing like me!"<br />
<br />
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."<br />
She say, "You must be jokin.'" I say, "I wish I was!"<br />
Then she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?"<br />
At least that's what I think I hear her say<br />
Well I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"<br />
<br />
Well, she says, "You just don't seem like you do!"<br />
I said, "You're way wrong."<br />
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I read Erica Jong!"<br />
She goes away for a minute and I slide out out of my chair<br />
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere<br />
<br />
Well my heart's in the Highlands, with the horses and hounds<br />
Way up in the border country, far from the towns<br />
With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow<br />
My heart's in the Highlands<br />
Can't see any other way to go<br />
<br />
Every day is the same thing out the door<br />
Feel further away then ever before<br />
Some things in life, it gets too late to learn<br />
Well, I'm lost somewhere<br />
I must have made a few bad turns<br />
<br />
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes<br />
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright colored clothes<br />
All the young men with their young women looking so good<br />
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em<br />
In a minute, if I could<br />
<br />
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog<br />
Talking to myself in a monologue<br />
I think what I need might be a full length leather coat<br />
Somebody just asked me<br />
If I'm registered to vote<br />
<br />
The sun is beginning to shine on me<br />
But it's not like the sun that used to be<br />
The party's over and there's less and less to say<br />
I got new eyes<br />
Everything looks far away<br />
<br />
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day<br />
Over the hills and far away<br />
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow<br />
But I'm already there in my mind<br />
And that's good enough for now</p>
