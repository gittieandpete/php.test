<br />
Like a ship on the sea, her love rose over me<br />
Like a ship on the sea, her love rose over me<br />
Go away, go away, let me be<br />
<br />
Like a weepin' willow tree, her love grows over me<br />
Like a weepin' willow tree, her love grows over me<br />
Go 'way, go 'way, let me be<br />
(Hauntin' me like a ship on the sea)<br />
<br />
Standin' on the white cliffs of Dover<br />
Lookin' out into space<br />
<br>
Another channel to cross over<br />
Another dream to chase<br />
<br />
The night is dark and dreary<br />
The wind is howling down<br />
Your heart is hanging heavy<br />
When your sweet love ain't around<br />
<br />
Like a leaf on a tree, her love is shakin' me<br />
Like a leaf on a tree, her love is shakin' me<br />
Go away, go away, let me be<br />
(Hauntin' me like a ship on the sea)<br />
Like a leaf, like a ship on the sea<br />
(Hauntin' me like a ship on the sea)</p>
