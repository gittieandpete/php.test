If I had wings like noah's dove<br />
I'd fly up the river to the one I love<br />
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well<br />
<br />
If I met your man, who was long and tall<br />
I'd hit his body like a cannon ball<br />
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well<br />
<br />
One of these days and it won't be long<br />
Call my name and I'll be gone<br />
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well<br />
<br />
I remember one night, a drizzling rain<br />
Round my heart I felt an achin' pain<br />
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well<br />
<br>
<br />
When I wore my apron low<br />
Couldn't keep you from my do'<br />
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well<br />
<br />
Now I wear my apron high<br />
Scarcely ever see you passing by<br />
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well<br />
<br />
Now my apron's up to my chin<br />
You pass my door and you won't come in<br />
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well<br />
<br />
If I had listened to what my mama said<br />
I'd be at home in my mama's bed<br />
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well</p>
