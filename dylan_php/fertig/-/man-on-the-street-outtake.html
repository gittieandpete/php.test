Well, I'll sing you a song, it ain't very long<br />
About an old man, he never done wrong<br />
How he died nobody can say<br />
They found him dead in the street one day<br />
And the crowd, they gathered one fine morn<br />
At the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn<br />
There on the sidewalk he did lay<br />
They stopped an' stared and they went their way<br />
Well, the policeman come and he looked around<br />
"Get up, old man, or I'm takin' you down"<br />
<br>
He jabbed him once with his billy club<br />
The old man then rolled off the curb<br />
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said<br />
"Call the wagon, this man is dead"<br />
The wagon come, they loaded him in<br />
I never saw the man again<br />
Well, I've sung you my song, it ain't very long<br />
About an old man who never done wrong<br />
How he died nobody can say<br />
They found him dead in the street one day</p>
