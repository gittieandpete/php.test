Nobody feels any pain<br />
Tonight as I stand inside the rain<br />
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes<br />
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows<br />
Have fallen from her curls<br />
<br />
She takes just like a woman<br />
Yes, she does, she makes love just like a woman<br />
Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman<br />
But she breaks just like a little girl<br />
<br />
Queen Mary, she's my friend<br />
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again<br />
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed<br />
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest<br />
With her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls<br />
<br />
She takes just like a woman<br />
<br>
Yes, she makes love just like a woman<br />
Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman<br />
But she breaks just like a little girl<br />
<br />
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst<br />
So I came in here<br />
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse<br />
Is this pain in here, I can't stay in here, ain't it clear<br />
<br />
That I just can't fit<br />
Yes, I believe that it's time for us to quit<br />
But when we meet again, introduced as friends<br />
Please don't let on that you knew me when<br />
I was hungry and it was your world<br />
<br />
Ah, you fake just like a woman<br />
Yes, you do, you make love just like a woman<br />
Yes, you do, then you ache just like a woman<br />
But you break just like a little girl</p>
