Time passes slowly up here in the mountain<br />
We sit beside the bridges and walk beside the fountains<br />
Catch the wild fishes that float though the stream<br />
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream<br />
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking<br />
She sat in the kitchen while her mama was cooking<br />
Stared on out the window to the stars high above<br />
Time passes slowly when you're searching for love<br />
<br>
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town<br />
Ain't no reason to go to the fair<br />
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down<br />
Ain't no reason to go anywhere<br />
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight<br />
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right<br />
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day<br />
Time passes slowly and fades away</p>
