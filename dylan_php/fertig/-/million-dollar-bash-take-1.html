Well, that big dumb blonde<br />
With her wheel gorged<br />
Turtle, that friend of hers<br />
With his checks all forged<br />
And his cheeks in a chunk<br />
With his cheese in the cash<br />
They're all gonna be there<br />
At that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
It's that million dollar bash<br />
<br />
Ev'rybody from right now<br />
To over there and back<br />
The louder they come<br />
The bigger they crack<br />
Come now, sweet cream<br />
Don't forget to flash<br />
We're all gonna meet<br />
At that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
It's that million dollar bash<br />
<br />
Well, I took my counselor<br />
Out to the barn<br />
Silly Nelly was there<br />
She told him a yarn<br />
Then along came Jones<br />
<br>
Emptied the trash<br />
Ev'rybody went down<br />
To that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
It's that million dollar bash<br />
<br />
Well, I'm hittin' it too hard<br />
My stones won't take<br />
I get up in the mornin'<br />
But it's too early to wake<br />
First it's hello, goodbye<br />
Then push and then crash<br />
But we're all gonna make it<br />
At that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
It's that million dollar bash<br />
<br />
Well, I looked at my watch<br />
I looked at my wrist<br />
I punched myself in the face<br />
With my fist<br />
I took my potatoes<br />
Down to be mashed<br />
And I made it on over<br />
To that million dollar bash<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee<br />
It's that million dollar bash</p>
