You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend<br />
When I was down, you just stood there grinning<br />
You got a lotta nerve to say you gotta helping hand to lend<br />
You just want to be on the side that's winning<br />
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that<br />
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it?<br />
You say you lost your faith but that's not where it's at<br />
You have no faith to lose and you know it<br />
I know the reason that you talk behind my back<br />
I used to be among the crowd you're in with<br />
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact<br />
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?<br />
<br>
You see me on the street, you always act surprised<br />
You say, "How are you? Good luck," but you don't mean it<br />
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed<br />
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?<br />
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace<br />
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them<br />
And now I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place<br />
Don't you understand, it's not my problem<br />
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes<br />
And just for that one moment, I could be you<br />
Yes, I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes<br />
You'd know what a drag it is to see you</p>
