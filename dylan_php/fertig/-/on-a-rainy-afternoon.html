Now she's walkin' in the morning<br />
Howlin' you come home<br />
I'll be on my way, so long, forlorn<br />
You just can't go<br />
<br />
I will get it if I have to<br />
If I have to please come home<br />
Try, but I'll be dry, and I crave you<br />
If I haunt you back all day<br />
<br />
Carry my trouble<br />
Yes you satisfy my mind<br />
I'll try to tell you, if I can't come in<br />
And I must stay true<br />
<br />
I'll be happy in the morning<br />
I try my best, I will try to help you<br />
If I can, and I leave it too<br />
But I just can't find you away<br />
Won't some time away<br />
<br />
That's the way I think she told mee [??]<br />
<br>
Heart she bent on me [??]<br />
I'll be out all morning, for you<br />
But you can't stop me<br />
<br />
Yes, I try my best to please you<br />
Try my best, but if I fail<br />
You must help me to see you<br />
As I go by...<br />
<br />
Dylan: No, it's twice as slow. Twice as slow. It's too fast<br />
Yeah, but it can go in there, man, but it's just gonna be twice as slow as that<br />
I'll fit the words in, same words, but it's gonna be twice as slow. Play every chord about twice as slow<br />
Dylan: OK. let's try it again<br />
<br />
Now, if you send me a letter<br />
I'll be on my way to get it for you<br />
I'll be with my sister too<br />
I can't find me what to do<br />
<br />
Yes, I've been trying to get a message<br />
To you, but you have to treat me<br />
I won't let her to<br />
And then I try my best to hunt her, you..</p>
