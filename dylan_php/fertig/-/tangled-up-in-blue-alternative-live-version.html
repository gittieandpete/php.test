Early one morning, the sun was shining<br />
I was laying in bed<br />
Wondering if she'd changed it all<br />
If her hair was still red<br />
Her folks, they said our lives together<br />
Sure was gonna be rough<br />
They never did like mama's homemade dress<br />
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough<br />
And I was standing on the side of the road<br />
Rain falling on my shoes<br />
Heading out for the east coast<br />
Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
She was married when we first met<br />
Soon to be divorced<br />
I helped her out of a jam, I guess<br />
But I used a little too much force<br />
We drove that car as far as we could<br />
Abandoned it out west<br />
Split up on a dark, sad night<br />
Both agreeing it was best<br />
She turned around to look at me<br />
As I was walking away<br />
I heard her say over my shoulder<br />
"We'll meet again someday on the avenue"<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
I had a job in the great north woods<br />
Working as a cook for a spell<br />
But I never did like it all that much<br />
And one day the axe just fell<br />
So I drifted down to New Orleans<br />
Where I's lucky for to be employed<br />
Working for a while on a fishing boat<br />
Right outside of Delacroix<br />
But all the while I was alone<br />
The past was close behind<br />
I seen a lot of women<br />
But she never escaped my mind and I just grew<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
She was working in a topless place<br />
And I stopped in for a beer<br />
I just kept looking at the sight of her face<br />
In the spotlight so clear<br />
And later on when the crowd thinned out<br />
I's just about to do the same<br />
<br>
She was standing there in back of my chair<br />
Said, "Tell me, don't I know your name?"<br />
I muttered something underneath my breath<br />
She studied the lines on my face<br />
I must admit I felt a little uneasy<br />
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe<br />
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said<br />
"You look like the silent type"<br />
Then she opened up a book of poems<br />
And handed it to me<br />
Written by an Italian poet<br />
From the thirteenth century<br />
And every one of them words rang true<br />
And glowed like burning coal<br />
Pouring off of every page<br />
Like it was written in my soul from me to you<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
I lived with them on Montague Street<br />
In a basement down the stairs<br />
There was music in the caf√©s at night<br />
And revolution in the air<br />
Then he started into dealing with slaves<br />
And something inside of him died<br />
She had to sell everything she owned<br />
And froze up inside<br />
And when finally the bottom fell out<br />
I became withdrawn<br />
The only thing I knew how to do<br />
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew<br />
Tangled up in blue<br />
<br />
So now I'm going back again<br />
I got to get her somehow<br />
All the people we used to know<br />
They're an illusion to me now<br />
Some are mathematicians<br />
Some are carpenter's wives<br />
Don't know how it all got started<br />
I don't what they do with their lives<br />
But me, I'm still on the road<br />
Heading for another joint<br />
We always did feel the same<br />
We just saw it from a different point of view<br />
Tangled up in blue</p>
