Nobody feels any pain<br />
Tonight as I stand inside the rain<br />
Ev'rybody knows<br />
That Baby's got new clothes<br />
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows<br />
Have fallen from her curls<br />
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does<br />
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does<br />
And she aches just like a woman<br />
But she breaks just like a little girl<br />
Queen Mary<br />
She's my friend<br />
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again<br />
Nobody has to guess<br />
That Baby can't be blessed<br />
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest<br />
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls<br />
She takes just like a woman, yes<br />
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does<br />
<br>
And she aches just like a woman<br />
But she breaks just like a little girl<br />
It was raining from the first<br />
And I was dying there of thirst<br />
So I came in here<br />
And your long-time curse hurts<br />
But what's worse<br />
Is this pain in here<br />
I can't stay in here<br />
Ain't it clear that<br />
I just can't fit<br />
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit<br />
But when we meet again<br />
Introduced as friends<br />
Please don't let on that you knew me when<br />
I was hungry and it was your world<br />
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do<br />
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do<br />
Then you ache just like a woman<br />
But you break just like a little girl</p>
