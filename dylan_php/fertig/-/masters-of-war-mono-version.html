Come, you masters of war<br />
You that build the big guns<br />
You that build the death planes<br />
You that build all the bombs<br />
You that hide behind walls<br />
You that hide behind desks<br />
I just want you know<br />
I can see through your masks<br />
<br />
You that never done nothin'<br />
But build to destroy<br />
You play with my world<br />
Like it's your little toy<br />
You put a gun in my hand<br />
And you hide from my eyes<br />
And you turn and run farther<br />
When the fast bullets fly<br />
<br />
Like Judas of old<br />
You lie and deceive<br />
A world war can be won<br />
You want me to believe<br />
But I see through your eyes<br />
And I see through your brain<br />
Like I see through the water<br />
That runs down my drain<br />
<br />
You fasten all the triggers<br />
For the others to fire<br />
Then you set back and watch<br />
While the death count gets higher<br />
You hide in your mansion<br />
As young people's blood<br />
Flows out of their bodies<br />
And is buried in the mud<br />
<br>
<br />
You've thrown the worst fear<br />
That can ever be hurled<br />
Fear to bring children<br />
Into the world<br />
For threatenin' my baby<br />
Unborn and unnamed<br />
You ain't worth the blood<br />
That runs in your veins<br />
<br />
How much do I know<br />
To talk out of turn<br />
You might say that I'm young<br />
You might say I'm unlearned<br />
But there's one thing I know<br />
Though I'm younger than you<br />
Even Jesus would never<br />
Forgive what you do<br />
<br />
Let me ask you one question<br />
Is your money that good<br />
Will it buy you forgiveness<br />
Do you think that it could<br />
I think you will find<br />
When your death takes it toll<br />
All the money you made<br />
Will never buy back your soul<br />
<br />
And I hope that you die<br />
And your death will come soon<br />
I'll follow your casket<br />
On a pale afternoon<br />
And I'll watch while you're lowered<br />
Down to your death bed<br />
And I'll stand over your grave<br />
'Til I'm sure that you're dead</p>
