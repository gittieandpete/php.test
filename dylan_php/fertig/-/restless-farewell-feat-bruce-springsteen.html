Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend<br />
Be it mine right or wrongfully<br />
I let it slip gladly to my friends<br />
To tie up the time most forcefully<br />
<br />
But the bottles are done, we've killed each one<br />
And the table's full and overflowed<br />
And the corner sign says it's closing time<br />
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road<br />
<br />
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched<br />
I did not do it harmfully<br />
And every girl that ever I've hurt<br />
I did not do it knowingly<br />
<br />
But to remain as friends<br />
You need the time to make amends and stay behind<br />
And since my feet are now fast and point away from the past<br />
I'll bid farewell and be down the line<br />
<br />
Oh, every foe that ever I faced<br />
The cause was there before we came<br />
And every cause that ever I fought<br />
I fought it full without regret or shame<br />
<br>
<br />
But the dark does die<br />
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes must meet the dawn<br />
And if I see the day I'd only have to stay<br />
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone<br />
<br />
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind<br />
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung<br />
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes<br />
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung<br />
<br />
But the time ain't tall<br />
Yet on time you depend and no word is possessed by no special friend<br />
And though the line is cut, it ain't quite the end<br />
I'll just bid farewell 'til we meet again<br />
<br />
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time<br />
To disgrace, distract, and bother me<br />
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face<br />
And the dust of rumors covers me<br />
<br />
But if the arrow is straight and the point is slick<br />
It can pierce through dust, no matter how thick<br />
So I'll make my stand and remain as I am<br />
And bid farewell and not give a damn</p>
