I'm trippin' over dumb drunks at a party<br />
Girlfriend just ran off with the DJ<br />
I give her everything, but she refused it<br />
It doesn't matter, she don't know how to use it<br />
My confidence is dwindling<br />
Look at the shape I'm in<br />
Where's my pearls, where's my swine?<br />
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line<br />
<br />
I'll have the usual<br />
I'll have the usual<br />
Fifty silhouettes bumpin' on the dance floor<br />
Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door<br />
Sixty cigarettes a day 'cause I'm nervous<br />
When will that bitch serve us?<br />
<br />
I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life<br />
Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife<br />
She was good, I was unkind<br />
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line<br />
<br />
<br>
I'll have the usual<br />
I'll have the usual<br />
(On the rocks)<br />
(Two ice cubes)<br />
(And a little umbrella)<br />
<br />
Big Jim says the second comin's comin'<br />
I think he's just seein' double or something<br />
Or something<br />
<br />
You can hang around waiting for the also rans<br />
I can't win, but I've seen enough, man<br />
A fifth of whiskey he could knock it away<br />
I drink some more and it's judgment day<br />
I had a future, but she just passed out<br />
I'm gonna drink until I see what it is I wanna think about<br />
<br />
I'll have the usual<br />
I'll have the usual<br />
I'll have the usual<br />
On the rocks<br />
With a twist</p>
