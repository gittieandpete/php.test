Everything went from bad to worse<br />
Money never changed a thing<br />
Death kept followin', trackin' us down<br />
At least I heard your bluebird sing<br />
Now somebody's got to show their hand<br />
Time is an enemy<br />
I know you're long gone<br />
I guess it must be up to me<br />
<br />
If I'd thought about it I never would've done it<br />
I guess I would've let it slide<br />
If I'd-a paid attention to what others were thinkin'<br />
The heart inside me would've died<br />
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity<br />
Someone had to reach for the risin' star<br />
I guess it was up to me<br />
<br />
Oh, the union central is pullin' out<br />
The orchids are in bloom<br />
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume<br />
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously<br />
Somebody's got to find your trail<br />
I guess it must be up to me<br />
<br />
It was like a revelation<br />
When you betrayed me with your touch<br />
I'd just about convinced myself nothin' had changed that much<br />
The old rounder in the iron mask he slipped me the master key<br />
Somebody had to unlock your heart He said it was up to me<br />
<br />
Now I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club<br />
I would've followed you in the door but I didn't have a ticket stub<br />
So I waited all night 'til the break of day, hopin' one of us could get free<br />
When the dawn came over the river bridge<br />
I knew it was up to me<br />
<br />
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk<br />
<br>
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work<br />
Was I a fool or not to try to protect your real identity?<br />
You looked a little burned out, my friend<br />
I thought it might be up to me<br />
<br />
I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat<br />
She's everything I need and love but I can't be swayed by that<br />
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be<br />
But she ain't a-gonna make me move, I guess it must be up to me<br />
<br />
Now we heard the sermon on the mount and I knew it was too complex<br />
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects<br />
When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty<br />
Somebody's got to tell the tale<br />
I guess it must be up to me<br />
<br />
Dupree came in pimpin' tonight to the Thunderbird cafe<br />
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way<br />
Now, I just can't rest without your love, I need your company<br />
But you ain't a-gonna cross the line<br />
I guess it must be up to me<br />
<br />
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle<br />
She's the one you been wond'rin' about, but there's really nothin' much to tell<br />
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history<br />
Somebody's got to cry some tears<br />
I guess it must be up to me<br />
<br />
So go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime<br />
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time<br />
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property<br />
One of us has got to hit the road<br />
I guess it must be up to me<br />
<br />
If we never meet again, baby, remember me<br />
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody<br />
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free<br />
No one else could play that tune, you know it was up to me</p>
