He sits in your room, his tune with a fistful of tracks<br />
Preoccupied with his vengance<br />
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back<br />
You know that he has no intentions<br />
Of looking your way, unless, it's to say that he needs you<br />
To test his inventions<br />
<br />
Hey! Crawl out your window, e'mon don't say it'll ruin you<br />
Come on down't say he'll haunt you<br />
You can go back to him anytime you want to<br />
<br />
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels?<br />
Trying to peel the moon and expose it<br />
With his business ander and his blood hounds that kneel<br />
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it<br />
He just needs you tot talk, or to hand him his chalk<br />
<br>
Or pick it up after he throws it ...<br />
<br />
Hey! Crawl out your window, e'mon don't say it'll ruin you<br />
Come on down't say he'll haunt you<br />
You can go back to him anytime you want to<br />
<br />
Why does he look so righteous, while your face is so changed<br />
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in<br />
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange<br />
Their religion of little tin women<br />
To back up their views, but your face is so bruised<br />
Come out! The dark is beginning<br />
<br />
Hey! Crawl out your window, e'mon don't say it'll ruin you<br />
Come on down't say he'll haunt you<br />
You can go back to him anytime you want to</p>
