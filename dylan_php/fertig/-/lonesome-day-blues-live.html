Well, today has been a sad and lonesome day<br />
Yeah, today has been a sad and lonesome day<br />
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away<br />
<br />
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor<br />
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor<br />
When I left my longtime darling, she was standing in the door<br />
<br />
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war<br />
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war<br />
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore<br />
<br />
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months<br />
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months<br />
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once<br />
<br />
Well the road washed out, weather not fit for man or beast<br />
Well the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast<br />
Funny, the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least<br />
<br />
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive<br />
<br>
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive<br />
Set my dial on the radio I wish my mother was still alive<br />
<br />
I seen your lover man comin', comin' across the barren fields<br />
I see your lover man comin', comin' 'cross the barren fields<br />
He not a gentleman at all, he's rotten to the core, he's a coward and he steals<br />
<br />
Well my captain, he's decorated, he's well-schooled and he's skilled<br />
My captain, he's decorated, he's well-schooled and he's skilled<br />
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all; how many of his pals have been killed<br />
<br />
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was<br />
Last night the wind was whispering something, I was trying to make out what it was<br />
Yeah I tell myself something's coming, but it never does<br />
<br />
I'm going to spare the defeated, I'm going to speak to the crowd<br />
I'm going to spare the defeated, 'cause I'm going to speak to the crowd<br />
I'm going to teach peace to the conquered, I'm going to tame the proud<br />
<br />
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf<br />
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf<br />
You're gonna need my help sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself</p>
