[Verse 1: ]<br />
She was there at the bar, she heard my guitar<br />
She was long and tall, she was the queen of them all<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
<br />
[Verse 2: ]<br />
She was dark and discreet, she was light on her feet<br />
We went up to her room and she lowered the boom<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
<br />
[Verse 3: Roy Orbison]<br />
Down below they danced and sang in the street<br />
While up above the walls were steaming with heat<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
<br />
[Verse 4: ]<br />
<br>
I was feeling no pain, feeling good in my brain<br />
I looked in her eyes, they were full of surprise<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Last night, talking about last night<br />
Last night, talking about last night<br />
<br />
[Verse 5: Roy Orbison]<br />
I asked her to marry me she smiled and pulled out a knife<br />
The party's just beginning she said, "Your money or you life?"<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Last night, talking about last night<br />
Last night, talking about last night<br />
<br />
[Verse 6: ]<br />
Now I'm back at the bar, she went a little too far<br />
She done me wrong, all I got is this song<br />
<br />
[Outro]<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
Last night, talking about last night<br />
Last night, talking about last night<br />
Last night, thinking about last night<br />
Last night...</p>
