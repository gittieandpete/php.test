Throw my ticket out the window,<br />
Throw my suitcase out there, too,<br />
Throw my troubles out the door,<br />
I don't need them any more<br />
'cause tonight i'll be staying here with you.<br />
<br />
I should have left this town this morning<br />
But it was more than i could do.<br />
Oh, your love comes on so strong<br />
And i've waited all day long<br />
For tonight when i'll be staying here with you.<br />
<br />
Is it really any wonder<br />
The love that a stranger might receive.<br />
<br>
You cast your spell and i went under,<br />
I find it so difficult to leave.<br />
<br />
I can hear that whistle blowin',<br />
I see that stationmaster, too,<br />
If there's a poor boy on the street,<br />
Then let him have my seat<br />
'cause tonight i'll be staying here with you.<br />
<br />
Throw my ticket out the window,<br />
Throw my suitcase out there, too,<br />
Throw my troubles out the door,<br />
I don't need them any more<br />
'cause tonight i'll be staying here with you.<br />
