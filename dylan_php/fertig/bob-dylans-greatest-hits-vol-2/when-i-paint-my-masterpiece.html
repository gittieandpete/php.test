Oh, the streets of rome are filled with rubble,<br />
Ancient footprints are everywhere.<br />
You can almost think that you're seein' double<br />
On a cold, dark night on the spanish stairs.<br />
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,<br />
Where i've got me a date with botticelli's niece.<br />
She promised that she'd be right there with me<br />
When i paint my masterpiece.<br />
<br />
Oh, the hours i've spent inside the coliseum,<br />
Dodging lions and wastin' time.<br />
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, i could hardly stand to see 'em,<br />
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.<br />
Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory,<br />
When i ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese.<br />
<br>
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody<br />
When i paint my masterpiece.<br />
<br />
Sailin' 'round the world in a dirty gondola.<br />
Oh, to be back in the land of coca-cola!<br />
<br />
I left rome and landed in brussels,<br />
On a plane ride so bumpy that i almost cried.<br />
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles,<br />
Everyone was there to greet me when i stepped inside.<br />
Newspapermen eating candy<br />
Had to be held down by big police.<br />
Someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent<br />
When i paint my masterpiece.<br />
