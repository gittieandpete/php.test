If today was not an endless highway,<br />
If tonight was not a crooked trail,<br />
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,<br />
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all.<br />
Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',<br />
Yes, and if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin',<br />
Only if she was lyin' by me,<br />
Then i'd lie in my bed once again.<br />
<br />
I can't see my reflection in the waters,<br />
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain,<br />
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps,<br />
Or can't remember the sound of my own name.<br />
<br>
Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',<br />
Yes, and if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin',<br />
Only if she was lyin' by me,<br />
Then i'd lie in my bed once again.<br />
<br />
There's beauty in the silver, singin' river,<br />
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky,<br />
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty<br />
That i remember in my true love's eyes.<br />
Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',<br />
Yes, and if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin',<br />
Only if she was lyin' by me,<br />
Then i'd lie in my bed once again.<br />
