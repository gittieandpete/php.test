Oh, the ragman draws circles<br />
Up and down the block.<br />
I'd ask him what the matter was<br />
But i know that he don't talk.<br />
And the ladies treat me kindly<br />
And furnish me with tape,<br />
But deep inside my heart<br />
I know i can't escape.<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
<br />
Well, shakespeare, he's in the alley<br />
With his pointed shoes and his bells,<br />
Speaking to some french girl,<br />
Who says she knows me well.<br />
And i would send a message<br />
To find out if she's talked,<br />
But the post office has been stolen<br />
And the mailbox is locked.<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
<br />
Mona tried to tell me<br />
To stay away from the train line.<br />
She said that all the railroad men<br />
Just drink up your blood like wine.<br />
An' i said, &quot;oh, i didn't know that,<br />
But then again, there's only one i've met<br />
An' he just smoked my eyelids<br />
An' punched my cigarette.&quot;<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
<br />
Grandpa died last week<br />
And now he's buried in the rocks,<br />
But everybody still talks about<br />
How badly they were shocked.<br />
But me, i expected it to happen,<br />
I knew he'd lost control<br />
When he built a fire on main street<br />
And shot it full of holes.<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
<br />
Now the senator came down here<br />
Showing ev'ryone his gun,<br />
Handing out free tickets<br />
To the wedding of his son.<br />
An' me, i nearly got busted<br />
An' wouldn't it be my luck<br />
<br>
To get caught without a ticket<br />
And be discovered beneath a truck.<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
<br />
Now the preacher looked so baffled<br />
When i asked him why he dressed<br />
With twenty pounds of headlines<br />
Stapled to his chest.<br />
But he cursed me when i proved it to him,<br />
Then i whispered, &quot;not even you can hide.<br />
You see, you're just like me,<br />
I hope you're satisfied.&quot;<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
<br />
Now the rainman gave me two cures,<br />
Then he said, &quot;jump right in.&quot;<br />
The one was texas medicine,<br />
The other was just railroad gin.<br />
An' like a fool i mixed them<br />
An' it strangled up my mind,<br />
An' now people just get uglier<br />
An' i have no sense of time.<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
<br />
When ruthie says come see her<br />
In her honky-tonk lagoon,<br />
Where i can watch her waltz for free<br />
'neath her panamanian moon.<br />
An' i say, &quot;aw come on now,<br />
You must know about my debutante.&quot;<br />
An' she says, &quot;your debutante just knows what you need<br />
But i know what you want.&quot;<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
<br />
Now the bricks lay on grand street<br />
Where the neon madmen climb.<br />
They all fall there so perfectly,<br />
It all seems so well timed.<br />
An' here i sit so patiently<br />
Waiting to find out what price<br />
You have to pay to get out of<br />
Going through all these things twice.<br />
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,<br />
To be stuck inside of mobile<br />
With the memphis blues again.<br />
