Ev'rybody's building the big ships and the boats,<br />
Some are building monuments,<br />
Others, jotting down notes,<br />
Ev'rybody's in despair,<br />
Ev'ry girl and boy<br />
But when quinn the eskimo gets here,<br />
Ev'rybody's gonna jump for joy.<br />
Come all without, come all within,<br />
You'll not see nothing like the mighty quinn.<br />
<br />
I like to do just like the rest, i like my sugar sweet,<br />
But guarding fumes and making haste,<br />
It ain't my cup of meat.<br />
Ev'rybody's 'neath the trees,<br />
Feeding pigeons on a limb<br />
<br>
But when quinn the eskimo gets here,<br />
All the pigeons gonna run to him.<br />
Come all without, come all within,<br />
You'll not see nothing like the mighty quinn.<br />
<br />
A cat's meow and a cow's moo, i can recite 'em all,<br />
Just tell me where it hurts yuh, honey,<br />
And i'll tell you who to call.<br />
Nobody can get no sleep,<br />
There's someone on ev'ryone's toes<br />
But when quinn the eskimo gets here,<br />
Ev'rybody's gonna wanna doze.<br />
Come all without, come all within,<br />
You'll not see nothing like the mighty quinn.<br />
