What's the matter with me,<br />
I don't have much to say,<br />
Daylight sneakin' through the window<br />
And i'm still in this all-night cafe.<br />
Walkin' to and fro beneath the moon<br />
Out to where the trucks are rollin' slow,<br />
To sit down on this bank of sand<br />
And watch the river flow.<br />
<br />
Wish i was back in the city<br />
Instead of this old bank of sand,<br />
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops<br />
And the one i love so close at hand.<br />
If i had wings and i could fly,<br />
I know where i would go.<br />
But right now i'll just sit here so contentedly<br />
And watch the river flow.<br />
<br />
People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah,<br />
Makes you stop and all wonder why.<br />
Why only yesterday i saw somebody on the street<br />
<br>
Who just couldn't help but cry.<br />
Oh, this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,<br />
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,<br />
And as long as it does i'll just sit here<br />
And watch the river flow.<br />
<br />
People disagreeing everywhere you look,<br />
Makes you wanna stop and read a book.<br />
Why only yesterday i saw somebody on the street<br />
That was really shook.<br />
But this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,<br />
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,<br />
And as long as it does i'll just sit here<br />
And watch the river flow.<br />
<br />
Watch the river flow,<br />
Watchin' the river flow,<br />
Watchin' the river flow,<br />
But i'll sit down on this bank of sand<br />
And watch the river flow.<br />
