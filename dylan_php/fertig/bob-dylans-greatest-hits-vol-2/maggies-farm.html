I ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more.<br />
No, i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more.<br />
Well, i wake in the morning,<br />
Fold my hands and pray for rain.<br />
I got a head full of ideas<br />
That are drivin' me insane.<br />
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.<br />
I ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more.<br />
<br />
I ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more.<br />
No, i ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more.<br />
Well, he hands you a nickel,<br />
He hands you a dime,<br />
He asks you with a grin<br />
If you're havin' a good time,<br />
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.<br />
I ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more.<br />
<br />
I ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more.<br />
No, i ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more.<br />
Well, he puts his cigar<br />
Out in your face just for kicks.<br />
<br>
His bedroom window<br />
It is made out of bricks.<br />
The national guard stands around his door.<br />
Ah, i ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more.<br />
<br />
I ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more.<br />
No, i ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more.<br />
Well, she talks to all the servants<br />
About man and god and law.<br />
Everybody says<br />
She's the brains behind pa.<br />
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four.<br />
I ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more.<br />
<br />
I ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more.<br />
No, i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more.<br />
Well, i try my best<br />
To be just like i am,<br />
But everybody wants you<br />
To be just like them.<br />
They sing while you slave and i just get bored.<br />
I ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more.<br />
