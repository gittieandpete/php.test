I've been around this whole country<br />
But I never yet found Fenneario.<br />
<br />
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down<br />
Well, as we marched down to Fennerio'<br />
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove<br />
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O<br />
<br />
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say<br />
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O<br />
What will your mother say to know you're going away<br />
You're never, never, never coming back-io ?<br />
<br />
Come a-running down your stairs<br />
Come a-running down your stairs<br />
<br>
Come a-running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O<br />
Come a-running down your stairs<br />
Combing back your yellow hair<br />
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io.<br />
<br />
The lieutenant he has gone<br />
The lieutenant he has gone<br />
The lieutenant he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O<br />
The lieutenant he has gone, long gone<br />
He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo.<br />
<br />
Well, our captain he is dead, our captain he is dead<br />
Our captain he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O<br />
Well, our captain he is dead, died for a maid<br />
He's buried somewhere in Louisiana-O.</p>
