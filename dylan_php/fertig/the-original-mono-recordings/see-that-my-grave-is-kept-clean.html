Well, there's one kind-a favor I'll ask of you<br />
Well, there's one kind-a favor I'll ask of you<br />
There's just one kind favor I'll ask of you<br />
You can see that my grave is kept clean<br />
<br />
And there's two white horses following me<br />
And there's two white horses following me<br />
I got two white horses following me<br />
Waiting on my burying ground<br />
<br />
Did you ever hear that coughin' sound?<br />
Did you ever hear that coughin' sound?<br />
Did you ever hear that coughin' sound?<br />
Means another poor boy is underground<br />
<br>
<br />
Did you ever hear them church bells tone?<br />
Have you ever hear that church bells tone?<br />
Did you ever hear them church bells tone?<br />
Means another poor boy is dead and gone<br />
<br />
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold<br />
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold<br />
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold<br />
Now I believe what the Bible told<br />
<br />
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you<br />
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you<br />
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you<br />
See that my grave is kept clean</p>
