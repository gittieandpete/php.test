Crimson flames tied through my ears, rollin' high and mighty traps<br />
Pounced with fire on flaming roads using ideas as my maps<br />
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I, proud 'neath heated brow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now<br />
<br />
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth, "rip down all hate," I screamed<br />
Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull, I dreamed<br />
Romantic facts of musketeers foundationed deep, somehow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now<br />
<br />
Girls' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy<br />
To memorizing politics of ancient history<br />
Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now<br />
<br>
<br />
A self-ordained professor's tongue too serious to fool<br />
Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school<br />
"Equality," I spoke the word as if a wedding vow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now<br />
<br />
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach<br />
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach<br />
My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now<br />
<br />
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect<br />
Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect<br />
Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow<br />
Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now</p>
