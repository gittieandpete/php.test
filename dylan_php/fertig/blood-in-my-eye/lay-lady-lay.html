Lay lady lay<br />
Lay across my big brass bed<br />
Lay lady lay<br />
Lay across my big brass bed<br />
<br />
Whatever colors you have in your mind<br />
I show them to you and you see them shine<br />
<br />
Lay lady lay<br />
Lay across my big brass bed<br />
Stay lady stay<br />
Stay with your man a while<br />
Until the break of day<br />
Let me see you make him smile<br />
<br />
His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean<br />
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen<br />
<br />
<br>
Stay lady stay<br />
Stay with your man a while<br />
<br />
Why wait any longer for the world to begin<br />
You can have your cake and eat it too<br />
Why wait any longer for the one you love<br />
When he's standing in front of you<br />
<br />
Lay lady lay<br />
Lay across my big brass bed<br />
Stay lady stay<br />
Stay while the night is still ahead<br />
<br />
I long to see you in the morning light<br />
I long to reach for you in the night<br />
<br />
Stay lady stay<br />
Stay while the night is still ahead</p>
