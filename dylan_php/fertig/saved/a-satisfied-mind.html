How many times have you heard someone say<br />
If I had his money I'd do things my way<br />
Hmm, but little they know<br />
Hmm, it's so hard to find<br />
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.<br />
<br />
Hmm, once I was wadding in fortune and fame<br />
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game<br />
But suddenly it happened<br />
<br>
Hmm, I lost every dime<br />
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.<br />
<br />
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out<br />
My friends and my love ones<br />
I'll leave there ain't no doubt<br />
But one thing for certain<br />
When it comes my time<br />
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.</p>
