Well, I'm hangin' on<br />
To a solid rock<br />
Made before the foundation of the world<br />
And I won't let go, and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go no more<br />
<br />
For me, He was chastised, for me, He was hated<br />
For me, he was rejected by a world that He created<br />
Nations are angry, cursed are some<br />
People are expecting a false peace to come<br />
<br />
Well, I'm hangin' on<br />
To a solid rock<br />
Made before the foundation of the world<br />
And I won't let go, and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go no more<br />
<br />
<br>
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit<br />
Twenty-four hours a day, you can feel it and you can hear it<br />
Using every angle under the sun<br />
And He never give up 'til the battle's lost or won<br />
<br />
Well, I'm hangin' on<br />
To a solid rock<br />
Made before the foundation of the world<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go no more<br />
<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go<br />
Won't let go and I can't let go</p>
