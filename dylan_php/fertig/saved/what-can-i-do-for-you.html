You have given everything to me.<br />
What can I do for You?<br />
You have given me eyes to see.<br />
What can I do for You?<br />
<br />
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,<br />
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied,<br />
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide<br />
And You've chosen me to be among the few.<br />
What can I do for You?<br />
<br />
You have laid down Your life for me.<br />
What can I do for You?<br />
You have explained every mystery.<br />
What can I do for You?<br />
<br />
<br>
Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly,<br />
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.<br />
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?<br />
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do.<br />
What can I do for You?<br />
<br />
You have given all there is to give.<br />
What can I do for You?<br />
You have given me life to live.<br />
How can I live for You?<br />
<br />
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,<br />
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,<br />
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart.<br />
Well, I don't deserve it but I sure did make it through.<br />
What can I do for You?</p>
