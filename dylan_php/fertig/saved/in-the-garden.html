When they came for Him in the garden, did they know? <br />
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know? <br />
Did they know He was the Son of God, did they know that He was Lord? <br />
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"? <br />
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know? <br />
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know? <br />
<br />
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear? <br />
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear? <br />
Nicodemus came at night so he wouldn't be seen by men <br />
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again." <br />
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear? <br />
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear? <br />
<br />
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see? <br />
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see? <br />
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk, why must you criticize? <br />
Same thing My Father do, I can do likewise." <br />
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see? <br />
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see? <br />
<br>
<br />
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare? <br />
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare? <br />
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head <br />
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead? <br />
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare? <br />
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare? <br />
<br />
When He rose from the dead, did they believe? <br />
When He rose from the dead, did they believe? <br />
He said, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth." <br />
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth? <br />
When He rose from the dead, did they believe? <br />
When He rose from the dead, did they believe? <br />
<br />
When He rose from the dead, did they believe? <br />
When He rose from the dead, did they believe? <br />
He said, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth." <br />
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth? <br />
When He rose from the dead, did they believe? <br />
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?</p>
