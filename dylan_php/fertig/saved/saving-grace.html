If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?<br />
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.<br />
I've escaped death so many times, I know I'm only living<br />
By the saving grace that's over me.<br />
<br />
By this time I'd-a thought I would be sleeping<br />
In a pine box for all eternity.<br />
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping<br />
For the saving grace that's over me.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection,<br />
Wherever I am welcome is where I'll be.<br />
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection<br />
Is the saving grace that's over me.<br />
<br />
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,<br />
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.<br />
As I look around this world all that I'm finding<br />
Is the saving grace that's over me.</p>
