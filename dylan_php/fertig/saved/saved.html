I was blinded by the devil,<br />
Born already ruined,<br />
Stone-cold dead<br />
As I stepped out of the womb.<br />
By His grace I have been touched,<br />
By His word I have been healed,<br />
By His hand I've been delivered,<br />
By His spirit I've been sealed.<br />
<br />
I've been saved<br />
By the blood of the lamb,<br />
Saved<br />
By the blood of the lamb,<br />
Saved,<br />
Saved,<br />
And I'm so glad.<br />
Yes, I'm so glad,<br />
I'm so glad,<br />
So glad,<br />
I want to thank You, Lord,<br />
I just want to thank You, Lord,<br />
Thank You, Lord.<br />
<br />
By His truth I can be upright,<br />
By His strength I do endure,<br />
By His power I've been lifted,<br />
In His love I am secure.<br />
He bought me with a price,<br />
Freed me from the pit,<br />
Full of emptiness and wrath<br />
And the fire that burns in it.<br />
<br />
I've been saved<br />
<br>
By the blood of the lamb,<br />
Saved<br />
By the blood of the lamb,<br />
Saved,<br />
Saved,<br />
And I'm so glad.<br />
Yes, I'm so glad,<br />
I'm so glad,<br />
So glad,<br />
I want to thank You, Lord,<br />
I just want to thank You, Lord,<br />
Thank You, Lord.<br />
<br />
Nobody to rescue me,<br />
Nobody would dare,<br />
I was going down for the last time,<br />
But by His mercy I've been spared.<br />
Not by works,<br />
But by faith in Him who called,<br />
For so long I've been hindered,<br />
For so long I've been stalled.<br />
<br />
I've been saved<br />
By the blood of the lamb,<br />
Saved<br />
By the blood of the lamb,<br />
Saved,<br />
Saved,<br />
And I'm so glad.<br />
Yes, I'm so glad, I'm so glad,<br />
So glad, I want to thank You, Lord,<br />
I just want to thank You, Lord,<br />
Thank You, Lord.</p>
