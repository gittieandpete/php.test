Well I'm pressing on<br />
Yes, I'm pressing on<br />
Well I'm pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my lord.<br />
<br />
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind<br />
Say, "Prove to me that He is Lord, show me a sign"<br />
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within<br />
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been ?<br />
<br />
Well I'm pressing on<br />
Yes, I'm pressing on<br />
<br>
Well I'm pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my lord.<br />
<br />
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back<br />
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack<br />
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign<br />
Because he sinned I got no choice, it run in my vein.<br />
<br />
Well I'm pressing on<br />
Yes, I'm pressing on<br />
Well I'm pressing on<br />
To the higher calling of my lord.</p>
