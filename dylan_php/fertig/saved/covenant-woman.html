Covenant Woman got a contract with the Lord<br />
Way up yonder, great will be her reward <br />
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star<br />
I know I can trust you to stay anywhere you are.<br />
<br />
Yes and I just got to tell you<br />
I do intend<br />
To stay closer than any friend<br />
Yes and I just to thank you<br />
Once again<br />
For making your prayers known<br />
Unto heaven for me<br />
And to you, always, so grateful<br />
I will forever be.<br />
<br />
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup<br />
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up<br />
And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true<br />
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.<br />
<br />
Yes and I just got to tell you<br />
I do intend<br />
<br>
To stay closer than any friend<br />
Yes and I just to thank you<br />
Once again<br />
For making your prayers known<br />
Unto heaven for me<br />
And to you, always, so grateful<br />
I will forever be.<br />
<br />
Covenant woman, intimate little girl<br />
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world<br />
You know that we are strangers in a land we're passing through<br />
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.<br />
<br />
Yea and I just got to tell you<br />
I do intend<br />
To stay closer than any friend<br />
Yea and I just to thank you<br />
Once again<br />
For making your prayers known<br />
Unto heaven for me<br />
And to you, always, so grateful<br />
I will forever be.</p>
