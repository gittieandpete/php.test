Are you ready, are you ready?<br />
Are you ready, are you ready?<br />
<br />
Are you ready to meet Jesus?<br />
Are you where you ought to be?<br />
Will He know you when He sees you<br />
Or will He say, "Depart from Me"?<br />
<br />
Are you ready, hope you're ready<br />
Am I ready, am I ready?<br />
Am I ready, am I ready?<br />
<br />
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren<br />
And to take up my cross?<br />
Have I surrendered to the will of God<br />
Or am I still like the boss?<br />
<br />
Am I ready, hope I'm ready.<br />
When the destruction cometh swiftly<br />
<br>
And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well<br />
Have you decided whether you want to be<br />
In heaven or in hell?<br />
<br />
Are you ready, are you ready?<br />
Have you got some unfinished business?<br />
Is there something holding you back?<br />
Are you thinking for yourself<br />
Or are you following the pack?<br />
<br />
Are you ready, hope you're ready<br />
Are you ready?<br />
<br />
Are you ready for the judgment?<br />
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?<br />
Are you ready for Armageddon?<br />
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?<br />
<br />
Are you ready, I hope you're ready?</p>
