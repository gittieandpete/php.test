Go 'way from my window,<br />
Leave at your own chosen speed.<br />
I'm not the one you want, babe,<br />
I'm not the one you need.<br />
 You say you're lookin' for someone<br />
Never weak but always strong,<br />
To protect you an' defend you<br />
Whether you are right or wrong,<br />
Someone to open each and every door,<br />
But it ain't me, babe,<br />
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br />
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.<br />
<br />
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,<br />
Go lightly on the ground.<br />
I'm not the one you want, babe,<br />
I will only let you down.<br />
You say you're lookin' for someone<br />
Who will promise never to part,<br />
<br>
Someone to close his eyes for you,<br />
Someone to close his heart,<br />
Someone who will die for you an' more,<br />
But it ain't me, babe,<br />
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br />
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.<br />
<br />
Go melt back into the night, babe,<br />
Everything inside is made of stone.<br />
There's nothing in here moving<br />
An' anyway I'm not alone.<br />
You say you're looking for someone<br />
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,<br />
To gather flowers constantly<br />
An' to come each time you call,<br />
A lover for your life an' nothing more,<br />
But it ain't me, babe,<br />
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br />
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.</p>
