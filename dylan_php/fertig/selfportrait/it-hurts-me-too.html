So run here baby, put your little hands in mine<br />
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind<br />
When things go wrong, so wrong with you<br />
It hurts me too<br />
<br />
I want you baby just to understand<br />
I don't want to be your boss babe, I just want to be your man<br />
When things go wrong, so wrong with you<br />
It hurts me too<br />
<br />
<br>
Now when you go home, you don't have to get along<br />
Come back to me babe, where I live that's where you belong<br />
When things go wrong, so wrong with you<br />
It hurts me too<br />
<br />
I love you baby an' you know that it's true<br />
I wouldn't mistreat you baby, nothin' in this world is like you<br />
When things go wrong, so wrong with you<br />
It hurts me too<br />
Yes when things go wrong, so wrong with you<br />
It hurts me too</p>
