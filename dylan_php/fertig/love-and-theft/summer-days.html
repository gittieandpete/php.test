Summer days, summer nights are gone<br />
Summer days and the summer nights are gone<br />
I know a place where there's still somethin' going on<br />
<br />
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out on in the mud<br />
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out lying in the mud<br />
I Got a long haired woman, she got royal Indian blood<br />
<br />
Everybody get ready, lift up your glasses and sing<br />
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing<br />
Well, I'm standin' on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king<br />
<br />
Well I'm drivin' in the flats in a Cadillac car<br />
The girls all say, "You're a worn out star"<br />
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime<br />
How can you say you love someone else when you know it's me all the time?<br />
<br />
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land<br />
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land<br />
What good are you anyway, if you can't stand up to some old businessman?<br />
<br />
Wedding bells ringin', the choir is beginning to sing<br />
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir is beginning to sing<br />
What looks good in the day, at night is another thing<br />
<br />
She's looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand<br />
She's looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand<br />
She says, "You can't repeat the past," I say, "You can't?<br />
What do you mean, you can't, of course you can!"<br />
<br />
Where do you come from? Where do you go?<br />
<br>
Sorry that's nothin' you would need to know<br />
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it's stuck<br />
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck<br />
<br />
I got eight carburetors, boys I'm using 'em all<br />
Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, I'm using 'em all<br />
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall<br />
<br />
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around<br />
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around<br />
I got my hammer ringin', pretty baby, but the nails ain't goin' down<br />
<br />
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace<br />
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace<br />
If it's information you want you can go get it from the police<br />
<br />
Politician got on his jogging shoes<br />
He must be running for office, got no time to lose<br />
He been suckin' the blood out of the genius of generosity<br />
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me<br />
<br />
Standing by God's river, my soul is beginnin' to shake<br />
Standing by God's river, my soul is beginnin' to shake<br />
I'm countin' on you love, to give me a break<br />
<br />
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift<br />
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift<br />
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift<br />
<br />
Summer days, summer nights are gone<br />
Summer days, summer nights are gone<br />
I know a place where there's still somethin' going on</p>
