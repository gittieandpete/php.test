Words and music by bob dylan<br />
<br />
Highwater risin', rising night and day<br />
All the gold and silver are being stolen away<br />
Big joe turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind<br />
He made it to kansas city, twelfth street and vine<br />
Nothin' standing there<br />
Highwater everywhere<br />
<br />
Highwater rising the shacks are sliding down<br />
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town<br />
Reformation shook it, broke it, then she hung it on the wall<br />
Say you dancin' with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all<br />
It's tough out there<br />
Highwater everywhere<br />
<br />
I got a craven love for blazin' speed<br />
I got a hopped up mustang ford<br />
Jump into the wagon, love<br />
Throw your panties overboard<br />
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind<br />
I'm no pig without a wig, i hope you treat me kind<br />
Things are breakin' up out there<br />
Highwater everywhere<br />
<br />
Highwater rising, six inches above my head<br />
<br>
Coffins droppin' in the street like balloons made out of lead<br />
Water poured into vicksburg, don't know what i'm gonna do<br />
Don't reach out for me, she said, can't you see i'm drowning too<br />
It's rough out there<br />
Highwater everywhere<br />
<br />
Well, george lewes told the englishman, the italian and the jew<br />
You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view<br />
They got charles darwin trapped out there on highway 5<br />
Judge says to the high sheriff, i want them dead or alive<br />
Either one, i don't care<br />
Highwater everywhere<br />
<br />
Well, the cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies<br />
I'm preachin' the word of god, i'm puttin' out your eyes<br />
I asked fat nancy for someth'n' to eat, she said take it off the shelf<br />
As great as you are man, you'll never be greater than yourself<br />
I told her i didn't really care<br />
Highwater everywhere<br />
<br />
I get up in the mornin', i believe i'll dust my broom<br />
Keepin' away from the women, i'm givin' them lots of room<br />
Thunder rollin' over clarksdale, everythin' a-lookin' blue<br />
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too<br />
It's bad out there<br />
Highwater everywhere<br />
