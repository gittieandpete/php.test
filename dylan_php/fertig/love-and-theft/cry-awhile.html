Well, I had to go down to see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith<br />
Nasty, dirty, double-crossin', back-stabbin' phony I didn't want to have to deal with<br />
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile<br />
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry awhile<br />
<br />
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan<br />
All right, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man<br />
I'm lettin' the cat out of the cage, I'm keepin' a low profile<br />
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile<br />
<br />
Feel like a fightin' rooster, feel better than I ever felt<br />
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is a-goin' to melt<br />
I went to the Church house, everyday I go an extra mile<br />
Well, I cry for you, now your turn, you can cry awhile<br />
<br />
Last night, 'cross the alley, there was a poundin' on the wall<br />
It must have been Don Pasquale makin' a 2 a.m. booty call<br />
<br>
To break a trusted heart like mine was just your style<br />
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry awhile<br />
<br />
I'm on the fringes of the night fightin' back tears that I can't control<br />
Some people they ain't human, they ain't got no heart or soul<br />
But I'm a-cryin' to the Lord, tryin' to be meek and mild<br />
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile<br />
<br />
Well the preacher's in the pulpit and the babiis in their cribs<br />
I'm longin' for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs<br />
I'm goin' t' buy me a barrel of whisky, I'll die before I turn senile<br />
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile <br />
<br />
Well, you bet on the horses, they ran the wrong way<br />
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day<br />
I might need a good lawyer, could be a funeral mad trial<br />
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile</p>
