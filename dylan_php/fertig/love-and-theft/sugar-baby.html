I've got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense<br />
I can see what everybody in the world is up against<br />
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far<br />
One day you'll open your eyes and you'll see where we are<br />
<br />
Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow<br />
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now<br />
<br />
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff.<br />
Plenty of places to hide things here if you want to hide them bad enough.<br />
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but you know she not really my aunt.<br />
Some of these memories, you can learn to live with and some of'em you can't<br />
<br />
Sugar baby get on down the line, you ain't got no brains nohow<br />
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now<br />
<br />
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doin' the Darktown strut<br />
Y'always got to be prepared, but you never know for what<br />
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring<br />
<br>
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing<br />
<br />
Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow<br />
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now<br />
<br />
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick<br />
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick<br />
Any minute of the day, the bubble can burst<br />
Try to make things better for someone sometimes you just end up makin' it thousand times worse<br />
<br />
Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow<br />
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now<br />
<br />
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one<br />
You got a way of tearin' the world apart, love, see what you've done<br />
Just as sure as we're livin', just as sure as you're born<br />
Look up, look up, seek your maker, for Gabriel blows his horn<br />
<br />
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense nohow<br />
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now</p>
