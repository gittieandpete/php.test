Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee<br />
They're throwin' knives into the tree<br />
Two big bags of dead man's bones<br />
Got their noses to the grind stone<br />
Livin' in the Land of Nod<br />
Trustin' their fate to the hands of God<br />
They pass by so silently<br />
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee<br />
<br />
Well, they're goin' to the country, they're goin' to retire<br />
They're takin' a streetcar named Desire<br />
Lookin' at a window with a pecan pie<br />
Lot of things they'd like they would never buy<br />
Neither of them .want. to turn and run<br />
They're makin' a noise to the Sun<br />
"His Master's Voice is calling me"<br />
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee<br />
<br />
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum<br />
I'll have more than thumb<br />
They walk among the stately trees<br />
They know the secrets of the breeze<br />
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,<br />
"Your presence is obnoxious to me.<br />
Feel like baby sittin' on a woman's knee."<br />
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, the rain beat'n' down on a window pane<br />
I got love for you, and it's all in vain<br />
Brains in a pot, they're beginning to boil<br />
They're drippin' with garlic and olive oil<br />
Tweedle Dee is on his hands and his knees<br />
Sayin', "Throw me something, Mister, please!"<br />
"What's good for you is good for me,"<br />
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.<br />
<br />
Well, they're living in a happy harmony<br />
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee<br />
They're one day older and a dollar short<br />
They got a prayer permit and a police escort<br />
They're lyin' low and they're makin' hay<br />
They seem determined to go all the way<br />
They run a brick 'n' tile company<br />
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee<br />
<br />
Well, the timeless stream has a deaf last meal<br />
And the noble truth is a sacred creed<br />
My pretty baby, she's looking around<br />
She's wearin' a multi-thousand dollar gown<br />
Tweedle Dee is a low down sorry old man<br />
Tweedle Dum he'll stab you where you stand<br />
"I've had too much of your company,"<br />
said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.</p>
