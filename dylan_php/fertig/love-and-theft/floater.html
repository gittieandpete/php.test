Down over the window<br />
From the dazzling sunlit rays<br />
through the back alleys, through the blinds<br />
another one of them endless days<br />
<br />
Honey bees are buzzing<br />
leaves begin to stir<br />
I'm in love with my second cousin<br />
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her<br />
<br />
I keep listening for footsteps<br />
but I ain't never hearing any<br />
from the boat, I fish for bullheads<br />
I catch a lot, sometimes too many<br />
<br />
A summer breeze is blowin'<br />
a squall is setting in<br />
sometimes it's just plain stupid<br />
to get into any kind of wind<br />
<br />
Well the old men 'round here<br />
sometimes they get on bad terms<br />
with the younger men,<br />
old, young, age don't carry weight<br />
it doesn't matter in the end<br />
<br />
One of the boss' hangers-on<br />
Sometimes comes to call<br />
At times you least expect<br />
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,<br />
inspire you with fear<br />
It has the opposite effect<br />
<br />
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town<br />
the old one is long gone<br />
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across<br />
Burns with the bark still on<br />
<br />
They say times are hard<br />
if you don't believe it you can follow your nose<br />
it don't bother me, times are hard anywhere<br />
we'll just have to see how it goes<br />
<br>
<br />
My old man, he's like some feudal lord<br />
he's got more lives than a cat<br />
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once<br />
things come alive or they fall flat<br />
<br />
You can smell the pine wood burnin'<br />
you can hear the school bell ring<br />
got to get up near the teacher, if you can<br />
if you wanna learn anything<br />
<br />
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion<br />
it don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch<br />
Juliet said back to Romeo,<br />
why don't you just shove off,<br />
if it bothers you so much<br />
<br />
They got outta here any way they could<br />
Cold rain can give you the shivers<br />
they went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,<br />
all the rest of them rebel rivers<br />
<br />
If you ever try to interfere with me<br />
or cross my path again,<br />
you do so at the peril of your life<br />
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound<br />
I've seen enough heartache and strife<br />
<br />
My grandfather was a duck trapper,<br />
he could do it with just dragnets and ropes (?)<br />
my grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,<br />
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.<br />
<br />
I had 'em once, though I suppose<br />
To go along with all the ring dancing,<br />
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves<br />
I left all my dreams and hopes<br />
buried under tobacco leaves<br />
<br />
Not always easy kicking someone up<br />
got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task<br />
sometimes somebody wants you to give something up<br />
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.</p>
