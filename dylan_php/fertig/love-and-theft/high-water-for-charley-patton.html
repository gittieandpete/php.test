High water risin' <br />
Risin' night and day <br />
All the gold and silver <br />
Are being stolen away <br />
<br />
Big Joe Turner lookin' East and West <br />
From the dark room of his mind <br />
He made it to Kansas City <br />
Twelfth Street and Vine <br />
<br />
Nothing standing there <br />
High water everywhere <br />
<br />
High water risin' <br />
The shacks are slidin' down <br />
Folks lose their possessions <br />
Folks are leaving town <br />
<br />
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it <br />
Then she hung it on a wall <br />
Says, "You're dancin' with whom they tell you to<br />
Or you don't dance at all." <br />
<br />
It's tough out there <br />
High water everywhere <br />
<br />
I got a cravin' love for blazing speed <br />
Got a hopped up Mustang Ford <br />
Jump into the wagon, love <br />
Throw your panties overboard <br />
<br />
I can write you poems <br />
Make a strong man lose his mind <br />
I'm no pig without a wig <br />
I hope you treat me kind <br />
<br />
Things are breakin' up out there <br />
High water everywhere <br />
<br />
High water risin' <br />
Six inches 'bove my head <br />
Coffins droppin' in the street <br />
Like balloons made out of lead <br />
<br />
<br>
Water pourin' into Vicksburg <br />
Don't know what I'm going to do <br />
"Don't reach out for me," she said <br />
"Can't you see I'm drownin' too?" <br />
<br />
It's rough out there <br />
High water everywhere <br />
<br />
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman <br />
The Italian and the Jew <br />
"You can't open your mind, boys <br />
To every conceivable point of view." <br />
<br />
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five <br />
Judge says to the High Sheriff <br />
"I want him dead or alive<br />
<br />
Either one, I don't care." <br />
High Water everywhere <br />
<br />
The Cuckoo is a pretty bird <br />
She warbles as she flies <br />
I'm preachin' the Word of God <br />
I'm puttin' out your eyes <br />
<br />
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat <br />
She said, "Take it off the shelf. <br />
As great as you are, man <br />
You'll never be greater than yourself." <br />
<br />
I told her I didn't really care <br />
High water everywhere <br />
<br />
I'm getting' up in the morning <br />
I believe I'll dust my broom <br />
Keeping away from the women <br />
I'm givin' 'em lots of room <br />
<br />
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale <br />
Everything is looking blue <br />
I just can't be happy, love <br />
Unless you're happy too <br />
<br />
It's bad out there <br />
High water everywhere</p>
