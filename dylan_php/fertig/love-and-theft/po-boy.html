Man came to the door, I say 'for whom were you lookin'?'<br />
Says 'your wife', I say 'she's busy in the kitchen cookin''<br />
Po' boy, where you been?<br />
Already told you, won't tell you again<br />
<br />
I say 'how much you want for that, I'll go into the store'<br />
Man says 'three dollars' 'all right', I say, 'will you take four?'<br />
Po' boy, never say die<br />
Things will be all right, by and by<br />
<br />
Workin' like in a main line, workin' like the devil<br />
The game is the same it's just up on another level<br />
Po' boy, dressed in black<br />
Police at your back<br />
<br />
Po' boy in a red hot town<br />
Out beyond the twinklin' stars<br />
Ridin' first class train<br />
Makin' the rounds<br />
Try to keep from fallin' between the cars<br />
<br />
Othello told Desdemona "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket"<br />
"By the way, what happened to that poisoned wine?"<br />
<br>
She said "I gave it to you, you drank it"<br />
Po' boy, layin' 'em straight<br />
Pickin' up the cherries fallin' off the plate<br />
<br />
Time and love has branded me with its claws<br />
Had to go to Florida, dodgin' them Georgia laws<br />
Po' boy in the hotel called the Palace of Bloom<br />
Called down to room service, said 'send up a room<br />
<br />
My mother was the daughter of a wealthy farmer<br />
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him<br />
When my mother died my uncle took me in to run a funeral parlor<br />
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him<br />
<br />
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss<br />
I don't know any more than this<br />
Po' boy, pickin' up sticks<br />
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks<br />
<br />
Knockin' on the door, I say 'who is it, where you from?'<br />
Man say 'Freddie', I say 'Freddie who?'<br />
He say 'Freddie or not, here I come'<br />
Po' boy 'neath the stars that shine<br />
Washin' them dishes, feedin' them swine</p>
