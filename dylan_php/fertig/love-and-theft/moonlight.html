The seasons they are turnin' and my sad heart is yearnin'<br />
To hear again the songbird's sweet melodious tone<br />
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?<br />
<br />
The dusky light, the day is losing<br />
Orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan<br />
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone<br />
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?<br />
<br />
The air is thick and heavy<br />
All along the levee<br />
Where the geese into the countryside have flown<br />
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?<br />
<br />
Well, I'm preachin' peace and harmony<br />
The blessings of tranquility<br />
Yet I know when the time is right to strike<br />
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear<br />
You've no need to linger here<br />
I know the kinds of things you like<br />
<br />
<br>
The clouds are turnin' crimson<br />
The leaves fall from the limbs an'<br />
The branches cast their shadows over stone<br />
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?<br />
<br />
The boulevards of cypress trees<br />
The masquerades of birds and bees<br />
The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown<br />
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?<br />
<br />
The trailing moss and mystic glow<br />
The purple blossoms soft as snow<br />
My tears keep flowing to the sea<br />
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief<br />
It takes a thief to catch a thief<br />
For whom does the bell toll for, love?<br />
It tolls for you and me<br />
<br />
My pulse is runnin' through my palm<br />
The sharp hills are rising from<br />
The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan<br />
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?</p>
