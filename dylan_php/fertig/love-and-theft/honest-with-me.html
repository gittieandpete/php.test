Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps<br />
Some of these women they just give me the creeps<br />
I'm avoidin' the south side the best I can<br />
These memories I got they can strangle a man<br />
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night<br />
Lot of things can get in the way when you're tryin' to do what's right<br />
<br />
You don't understand it, my feelin' for you<br />
You'd be honest with me if you only knew<br />
<br />
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done<br />
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we won<br />
The Siamese twins are comin' to town<br />
People can't wait, they've gathered around<br />
When I left my home the sky split open wide<br />
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died<br />
<br />
You don't understand it, my feelin' for you<br />
You'd be honest with me if only you knew<br />
<br />
My woman got a face like a teddy bear<br />
She's tossin' a baseball bat in the air<br />
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword<br />
I'm crashin' my car trunk first into the board<br />
<br>
They say that my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice<br />
Well, I'd sell it to ya at a reduced price<br />
<br />
You don't understand it, my feeling for you<br />
You'd be honest with me if only you knew<br />
<br />
Some things are too terrible to be true,<br />
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.<br />
There's a Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45<br />
I'm havin' a hard time, believing some people we're ever alive<br />
I'm stark naked but I don't care<br />
I'm goin' off into the woods I'm hunt'n' bear<br />
You don't understand it, my feeling for you<br />
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew<br />
<br />
I'm here to create the new imperial empire<br />
I'm gonna do whatever circumstances require<br />
I care so much for you, didn't think I could<br />
I can't tell my heart that you're no good<br />
Well, my parents, they warned me not to risk my years<br />
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears<br />
<br />
You don't understand it, my feeling for you<br />
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew</p>
