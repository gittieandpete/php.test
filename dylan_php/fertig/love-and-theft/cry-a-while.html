Well, I had to go down to see a guy named <br />
Mr. Goldsmith <br />
Nasty, dirty, double-crossin', back-stabbin' phony <br />
I didn't want to have to deal with <br />
<br />
But I did it for you <br />
And all you gave me was a smile <br />
Well, I cried for you <br />
Now it's your turn to cry a while <br />
<br />
I don't carry dead weight <br />
I'm no flash in the pan <br />
All right, I'll set you straight <br />
Can't you see I'm a union man <br />
<br />
I'm lettin' the cat out of the cage <br />
I'm keepin' a low profile <br />
Well, I cried for you <br />
Now it's your turn, you can cry a while <br />
<br />
Feel like a fightin' rooster <br />
Feel better than I ever felt <br />
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess <br />
And the Denver road is a-goin' to melt <br />
<br />
I went to the church house <br />
Every day I go an extra mile <br />
Well, I cried for you <br />
Now your turn, you can cry a while <br />
<br />
Last night, 'cross the alley <br />
There was a poundin' on the wall <br />
It must have been Don Pasquale <br />
Makin' a 2 a.m. booty call <br />
<br>
 <br />
To break a trusting heart like mine <br />
Was just your style <br />
Well, I cried for you <br />
Now it's your turn to cry a while <br />
<br />
I'm on the fringes of the night <br />
Fighting back my tears that I can't control <br />
Some people they ain't human <br />
They got no heart or soul <br />
<br />
But I'm a-cryin' to the Lord <br />
Tryin' to be meek and mild <br />
Yes, I've cried for you <br />
Now it's your turn, you can cry a while <br />
<br />
Well the preacher's in the pulpit <br />
And the babies in their cribs <br />
I'm longin' for that sweet fat <br />
That sticks to your ribs <br />
<br />
I'm goin' to buy me a barrel of whisky <br />
I'll die before I turn senile <br />
Yes, I've cried for you <br />
Now it's your turn, you can cry a while <br />
<br />
Well, you bet on the horses <br />
And they ran the wrong way <br />
I always said you'd be sorry <br />
And today could be the day <br />
<br />
I might need a good lawyer <br />
Could be your funeral, my trial <br />
Well, I cried for you <br />
Now it's your turn, you can cry a while</p>
