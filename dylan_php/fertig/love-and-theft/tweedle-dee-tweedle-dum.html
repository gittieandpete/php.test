Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee <br />
They're throwing knives into the tree <br />
Two big bags of dead man's bones <br />
Got their noses to the grindstones <br />
<br />
Living in the Land of Nod <br />
Trustin' their fate to the hands of God <br />
They pass by so silently <br />
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee <br />
<br />
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire <br />
They're taking a streetcar named Desire <br />
Looking in the window at the pecan pie <br />
Lot of things they'd like they would never buy <br />
<br />
Neither one gonna turn and run <br />
They're making a voyage to the sun <br />
"His Master's voice is calling me," <br />
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee <br />
<br />
Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum <br />
All that and more and then some <br />
They walk among the stately trees <br />
They know the secrets of the breeze <br />
<br />
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee <br />
"Your presence is obnoxious to me." <br />
They're like babies sittin' on a woman's knee <br />
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee <br />
<br>
 <br />
Well, the rain beating down on my window pane <br />
I got love for you and it's all in vain <br />
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil <br />
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil <br />
<br />
Tweedle-dee Dee, he's on his hands and his knees <br />
Saying, "Throw me somethin', Mister, please."<br />
"What's good for you is good for me," <br />
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee <br />
<br />
Well, they're living in a happy harmony <br />
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee <br />
They're one day older and a dollar short <br />
They've got a parade permit and a police escort <br />
<br />
They're lying low and they're makin' hay <br />
They seem determined to go all the way <br />
They run a brick and tile company <br />
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee <br />
<br />
Well a childish dream is a deathless need <br />
And a noble truth is a sacred creed <br />
My pretty baby, she's lookin' around <br />
She's wearin' a multi-thousand dollar gown <br />
<br />
Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man <br />
Tweedle-dee Dum, he'll stab you where you stand <br />
"I've had too much of your company," <br />
Says, Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee</p>
