Words and music by bob dylan<br />
<br />
Down over the window<br />
From the dazzling sunlit place<br />
Through the back alleys, through the blinds<br />
Another one of the memphis days<br />
<br />
Honey bees are buzzing<br />
Leaves begin to stir<br />
I'm in love with my second cousin<br />
I tell myself i could be happy forever with her<br />
<br />
I keep listening for footsteps<br />
But i ain't never hearing any<br />
From the boat, i fish for bullheads<br />
I catch a lot, sometimes too many<br />
<br />
A summer breeze is blowin'<br />
A squall is setting in<br />
Sometimes it's just plain stupid<br />
To get into any kind of wind<br />
<br />
Well the old men 'round here<br />
Sometimes they get on bad terms<br />
With the younger men,<br />
Old, young, age don't carry weight<br />
It doesn't matter in the end<br />
<br />
One of the boss' hangers-on<br />
Sometimes comes to call<br />
At times you least expect<br />
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,<br />
Inspire you with fear<br />
It has the opposite effect<br />
<br />
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town<br />
The other one is long gone<br />
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across<br />
Burns with the bark still on<br />
<br />
They say times are hard<br />
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose<br />
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere<br />
We'll just have to see how it goes<br />
<br>
<br />
My old man, he's like some feudal lord<br />
He's got more lives than a cat<br />
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once<br />
Things come alive or they fall flat<br />
<br />
You can smell the pine wood burnin'<br />
You can hear the school bell ring<br />
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can<br />
If you wanna learn anything<br />
<br />
Romeo, he said to juliet, you got a poor complexion<br />
That don't give your appearance a very youthful touch<br />
Juliet said back to romeo,<br />
Why don't you just shove off,<br />
If it bothers you so much<br />
<br />
They all got outta here any way they could<br />
Cold rain can give you the shivers<br />
They went down the ohio, the cumberland, the tennessee,<br />
All the rest of them rebel rivers<br />
<br />
If you ever try to interfere with me<br />
Or cross my path again,<br />
You do so at the peril of your life<br />
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as i sound<br />
I've seen enough heartache and strife<br />
<br />
My grandfather was a duck trapper,<br />
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes<br />
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,<br />
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes<br />
<br />
I had 'em once, though i suppose<br />
To go along with all the ring dancing,<br />
Christmas carols and all the christmas eves<br />
I left all my dreams and hopes<br />
Buried under tobacco leaves<br />
<br />
Not always easy kicking someone out<br />
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task<br />
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up<br />
And tears or not, it's too much to ask<br />
<br />
