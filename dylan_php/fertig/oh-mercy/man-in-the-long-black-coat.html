Crickets are chirpin' the water is high<br />
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry<br />
Window wide open African trees<br />
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze<br />
Not a word of goodbye not even a note<br />
She gone with the man in the long black coat.<br />
<br />
Somebody seen him hangin' around<br />
As the old dance hall on the outskirts of town<br />
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask<br />
If he wanted to dance he had a face like a mask<br />
Somebody said from the bible he'd quote<br />
There was dust on the man in the long black coat.<br />
<br />
Preacher was talking there's a sermon he gave<br />
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved<br />
<br>
You cannot depend on it to be your guide<br />
When it's you who must keep it satisfied<br />
It ain't easy to swallow it sticks in the throat<br />
She gave her heart to the man in the long black coat.<br />
<br />
There are no mistakes in life some people say<br />
It is true sometimes you can see it that way<br />
But people don't live or die people just float<br />
She went with the man in the long black coat.<br />
<br />
There's smoke on the water it's been there since June<br />
Tree trunks unprooted beneath the high crescent moon<br />
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force<br />
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse<br />
She never said nothing there was nothing she wrote<br />
She gone with the man in the long black coat.</p>
