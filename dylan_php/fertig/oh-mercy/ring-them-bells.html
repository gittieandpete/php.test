Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams<br />
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams<br />
For they're deep and they're wide<br />
And the world on its side<br />
And time is running backwards<br />
And so is the bride.<br />
<br />
Ring them bells Saint Peter where the four winds blow<br />
Ring them bells with an ironhand<br />
So the people will know<br />
Oh it's rush hour now<br />
On the wheel and the plow<br />
And the sun is going down upon the sacred cow.<br />
<br />
Ring them bells Sweet Martha for the poor man's son<br />
<br>
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one<br />
Oh the shepherd is asleep<br />
Where the willows weep<br />
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep<br />
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf<br />
Ring them bells for all of us who are left<br />
Ring them bells for the chosen few<br />
Who will judge the many when the game is through<br />
Ring them bells for the time that flies<br />
For the child that cries<br />
When innocence dies.<br />
<br />
Ring them bells Saint Catherine from the top of the room<br />
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom<br />
Oh the lines are long and the fighting is strong<br />
And they're breaking down the distance between right and wrong.</p>
