We live in a political world<br />
Love don't have any place<br />
We're living in times<br />
Where men commit crimes<br />
And crime don't have any face.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
Icicles hanging down<br />
Wedding bells ring<br />
And angels sing<br />
Clouds cover up the ground.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
Wisdom is thrown in jail<br />
It rots in a cell<br />
Is misguided as hell<br />
Leaving no one to pick up a trail.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
Where mercy walks the plank<br />
Life is in mirrors<br />
Death disappears<br />
Up the steps into the nearest bank.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
Where courage is a thing of the past<br />
Houses are haunted<br />
Children unwanted<br />
The next day could be your last.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
The one we can see and feel<br />
<br>
But there's no one to check<br />
It's all a stacked deck<br />
We all know for sure that it's real.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
In the cities of lonesome fear<br />
Little by little<br />
You turn in the middle<br />
But you're never sure why you're here.<br />
We live in a political world<br />
Under the microscope<br />
You can travel anywhere<br />
And hang yourself there<br />
You always got more than enough rope.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
Turning and trashing about<br />
As soon as you're awake<br />
You're trained to take <br />
What looks like the easy way out.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
Where peace is not welcome at all<br />
It's turned away from the door<br />
To wonder some more<br />
Or put up against the wall.<br />
<br />
We live in a political world<br />
Everything is hers and his<br />
Climb into the frame<br />
And shout God's name<br />
But you're never sure what it is.</p>
