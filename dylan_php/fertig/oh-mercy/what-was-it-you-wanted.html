What was it you wanted<br />
Tell me again so I'll know<br />
What's happening in there<br />
What's going on in your show<br />
What was it you wanted<br />
Could you say it again<br />
I'll be back in a minute<br />
You can get it together by then.<br />
<br />
What was it you wanted<br />
You can tell me I'm back<br />
We can start it all over<br />
Get it back on the track<br />
You got my attention<br />
Go ahead speak<br />
What was it you wanted.<br />
When you were kissing my cheek.<br />
<br />
Was there somebody looking<br />
When you give me that kiss<br />
Someone there in the shadows<br />
Someone that I might have missed<br />
Is there something you needed<br />
Something I don't understand<br />
What was it you wanted<br />
Do I have it here in my hand.<br />
<br />
Whatever you wanted<br />
Slipped out of my mind<br />
Would you remind me again<br />
If you'd be so kind<br />
<br>
Has the record been breaking<br />
Did the needle just skip<br />
Is there somebody waitin'<br />
Was there a slip of the lip.<br />
<br />
What was it you wanted<br />
It ain't keepin' score<br />
Are you the same person <br />
That was here before<br />
Is it something important<br />
Maybe not<br />
What was it you wanted.<br />
Tell me again I forgot.<br />
<br />
Whatever you wanted<br />
What can it be<br />
Did somebody tell you<br />
That you could get it from me<br />
Is it something that comes natural<br />
Is it easy to say<br />
Why do you want it<br />
Who are you anyway.<br />
<br />
Is the scenery changing<br />
Am I getting it wrong<br />
Is the whole thing going backwards<br />
Are they playing our song<br />
Where were you when it started<br />
Do you want it for free<br />
What was it you wanted<br />
Are you talking to me.</p>
