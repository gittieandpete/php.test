What good am I if I'm like all the rest <br />
If I just turned away, when I see how you're dressed <br />
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry <br />
What good am I? <br />
<br />
What good am I if I know and don't do <br />
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you <br />
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky <br />
What good am I? <br />
<br />
What good am I while you softly weep <br />
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep <br />
<br>
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try <br />
What good am I? <br />
<br />
What good am I then to others and me <br />
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see <br />
If my hands tied must I not wonder within <br />
Who tied them and why and where must I have been <br />
<br />
What good am I if I say foolish things <br />
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings <br />
And I just turn my back while you silently die <br />
What good am I?</p>
