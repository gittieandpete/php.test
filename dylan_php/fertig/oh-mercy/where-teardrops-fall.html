Far away where the soft winds blow<br />
Far away from it all<br />
There is a place you go<br />
Where teardrops fall.<br />
<br />
Far away in the stormy night<br />
Far away and over the wall<br />
You are there in the flickering light<br />
Where teardrops fall.<br />
<br />
We banged the drum slowly<br />
And played the fife lowly<br />
You know the song in my heart<br />
In the turning of twilight<br />
In the shadows of moonlight<br />
You can show me a new place to start.<br />
<br>
<br />
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup<br />
Strippin' away at it all<br />
Thinking of you when the sun comes up<br />
Where teardrops fall.<br />
<br />
By rivers of blindness<br />
In love and with kindness<br />
We could hold up a toast if we meet<br />
To the cuttin' of fences <br />
To sharpen the senses<br />
That linger in the fireball heat.<br />
<br />
Roses are red violets are blue<br />
And times is beginning to crawl<br />
I just might have to come to see you<br />
Where teardrops fall.</p>
