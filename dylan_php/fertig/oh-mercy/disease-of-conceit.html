There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit<br />
Whole lot of people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit<br />
Comes right down the highway straight down the line<br />
Rips into your senses through your body and your mind<br />
Nothing about it that's sweet<br />
The disease of conceit.<br />
<br />
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit<br />
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit<br />
Steps into your room eats into your soul<br />
Over your senses you have no control<br />
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.<br />
<br />
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit<br />
<br>
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit<br />
Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count<br />
From the outside world the pressure will mount<br />
Turn you into a piece of meat<br />
The disease of conceit.<br />
<br />
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure<br />
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure<br />
<br />
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit<br />
Whole lot of people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit<br />
Give you delusions of grandeur and evil eye<br />
Give you the idea that you're too good to die<br />
Then they bury you from your head to your feet<br />
From the disease of conceit.</p>
