In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need<br />
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed<br />
There's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere,<br />
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.<br />
<br />
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,<br />
Like cain, i now behold this chain of events that i must break.<br />
In the fury of the moment i can see the master's hand<br />
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.<br />
<br />
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,<br />
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.<br />
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way<br />
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.<br />
<br />
<br>
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame<br />
And every time i pass that way i always hear my name.<br />
Then onward in my journey i come to understand<br />
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.<br />
<br />
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night<br />
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,<br />
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,<br />
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.<br />
<br />
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea<br />
Sometimes i turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.<br />
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man<br />
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.<br />
