As i was out walking on a corner one day,<br />
I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay.<br />
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor<br />
And i guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.<br />
<br />
Only a hobo, but one more is gone<br />
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song<br />
Leavin' nobody to carry him home<br />
Only a hobo, but one more is gone<br />
<br />
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,<br />
As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed.<br />
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come<br />
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.<br />
<br />
<br>
Only a hobo, but one more is gone<br />
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song<br />
Leavin' nobody to carry him home<br />
Only a hobo, but one more is gone<br />
<br />
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,<br />
To look up on the world from a hole in the ground,<br />
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,<br />
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?<br />
<br />
Only a hobo, but one more is gone<br />
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song<br />
Leavin' nobody to carry him home<br />
Only a hobo, but one more is gone<br />
