Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat<br />
An' cov'rin' the crossroads i'm standing at,<br />
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,<br />
But mama, you been on my mind.<br />
<br />
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,<br />
I am not pleadin' or sayin', &quot;i can't forget.&quot;<br />
I do not walk the floor bowed down an' bent, but yet,<br />
Mama, you been on my mind.<br />
<br />
Even though my mind is hazy an' my thoughts they might be narrow,<br />
Where you been don't bother me nor bring me down in sorrow.<br />
<br>
It don't even matter to me where you're wakin' up tomorrow,<br />
But mama, you're just on my mind.<br />
<br />
I am not askin' you to say words like &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot;<br />
Please understand me, i got no place for you t' go.<br />
I'm just breathin' to myself, pretendin' not that i don't know,<br />
Mama, you been on my mind.<br />
<br />
When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your mirror.<br />
You know i won't be next to you, you know i won't be near.<br />
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear<br />
As someone who has had you on his mind.<br />
