Lazy stadium night<br />
Catfish on the mound.<br />
&quot;strike three,&quot; the umpire said,<br />
Batter have to go back and sit down.<br />
<br />
Catfish, million-dollar-man,<br />
Nobody can throw the ball like catfish can.<br />
<br />
Used to work on mr. finley's farm<br />
But the old man wouldn't pay<br />
So he packed his glove and took his arm<br />
An' one day he just ran away.<br />
<br />
Catfish, million-dollar-man,<br />
Nobody can throw the ball like catfish can.<br />
<br />
Come up where the yankees are,<br />
Dress up in a pinstripe suit,<br />
Smoke a custom-made cigar,<br />
Wear an alligator boot.<br />
<br />
Catfish, million-dollar-man,<br />
Nobody can throw the ball like catfish can.<br />
<br />
<br>
Carolina born and bred,<br />
Love to hunt the little quail.<br />
Got a hundred-acre spread,<br />
Got some huntin' dogs for sale.<br />
<br />
Catfish, million-dollar-man,<br />
Nobody can throw the ball like catfish can.<br />
<br />
Reggie jackson at the plate<br />
Seein' nothin' but the curve,<br />
Swing too early or too late<br />
Got to eat what catfish serve.<br />
<br />
Catfish, million-dollar-man,<br />
Nobody can throw the ball like catfish can.<br />
<br />
Even billy martin grins<br />
When the fish is in the game.<br />
Every season twenty wins<br />
Gonna make the hall of fame.<br />
<br />
Catfish, million-dollar-man,<br />
Nobody can throw the ball like catfish can.<br />
