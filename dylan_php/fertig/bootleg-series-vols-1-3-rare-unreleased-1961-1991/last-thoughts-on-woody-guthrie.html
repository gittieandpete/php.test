When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb<br />
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb<br />
When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace<br />
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race<br />
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up<br />
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup<br />
If the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on<br />
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone<br />
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it<br />
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it<br />
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long<br />
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong<br />
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day<br />
And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away<br />
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'<br />
And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'<br />
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys<br />
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys<br />
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'<br />
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'<br />
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'<br />
And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'<br />
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm<br />
And to yourself you sometimes say<br />
&quot;i never knew it was gonna be this way<br />
Why didn't they tell me the day i was born&quot;<br />
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat<br />
And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet<br />
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air<br />
And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare<br />
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying<br />
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'<br />
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet<br />
And you need it badly but it lays on the street<br />
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat<br />
And you think yer ears might a been hurt<br />
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt<br />
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush<br />
When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush<br />
And all the time you were holdin' three queens<br />
And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean<br />
Like in the middle of life magazine<br />
Bouncin' around a pinball machine<br />
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying<br />
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'<br />
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head<br />
And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed<br />
And no matter how you try you just can't say it<br />
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it<br />
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head<br />
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead<br />
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth<br />
And his jaws start closin with you underneath<br />
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind<br />
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign<br />
And you say to yourself just what am i doin'<br />
On this road i'm walkin', on this trail i'm turnin'<br />
On this curve i'm hanging<br />
On this pathway i'm strolling, in the space i'm taking<br />
In this air i'm inhaling<br />
Am i mixed up too much, am i mixed up too hard<br />
Why am i walking, where am i running<br />
What am i saying, what am i knowing<br />
On this guitar i'm playing, on this banjo i'm frailin'<br />
On this mandolin i'm strummin', in the song i'm singin'<br />
In the tune i'm hummin', in the words i'm writin'<br />
In the words that i'm thinkin'<br />
In this ocean of hours i'm all the time drinkin'<br />
Who am i helping, what am i breaking<br />
What am i giving, what am i taking<br />
But you try with your whole soul best<br />
Never to think these thoughts and never to let<br />
Them kind of thoughts gain ground<br />
Or make yer heart pound<br />
But then again you know why they're around<br />
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down<br />
&quot;cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping<br />
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping<br />
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'<br />
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking<br />
If that was you in the dream that was screaming<br />
And you know that it's something special you're needin'<br />
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'<br />
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding<br />
And you need something special<br />
Yeah, you need something special all right<br />
You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track<br />
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back<br />
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler<br />
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever<br />
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over<br />
You need a greyhound bus that don't bar no race<br />
That won't laugh at yer looks<br />
Your voice or your face<br />
And by any number of bets in the book<br />
Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze<br />
You need something to open up a new door<br />
To show you something you seen before<br />
But overlooked a hundred times or more<br />
<br>
You need something to open your eyes<br />
You need something to make it known<br />
That it's you and no one else that owns<br />
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting<br />
That the world ain't got you beat<br />
That it ain't got you licked<br />
It can't get you crazy no matter how many<br />
Times you might get kicked<br />
You need something special all right<br />
You need something special to give you hope<br />
But hope's just a word<br />
That maybe you said or maybe you heard<br />
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve<br />
<br />
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad<br />
And yer trouble is you know it too good<br />
&quot;cause you look an' you start getting the chills<br />
<br />
&quot;cause you can't find it on a dollar bill<br />
And it ain't on macy's window sill<br />
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map<br />
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house<br />
And it ain't made in no hollywood wheat germ<br />
And it ain't on that dimlit stage<br />
With that half-wit comedian on it<br />
Ranting and raving and taking yer money<br />
And you thinks it's funny<br />
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club<br />
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club<br />
And sure as hell you're bound to tell<br />
That no matter how hard you rub<br />
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub<br />
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you<br />
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you<br />
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house<br />
Or down any movie star's blouse<br />
And you can't find it on the golf course<br />
And uncle remus can't tell you and neither can santa claus<br />
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes<br />
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons<br />
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices<br />
That come knockin' and tappin' in christmas wrappin'<br />
Sayin' ain't i pretty and ain't i cute and look at my skin<br />
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow<br />
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry<br />
When you can't even sense if they got any insides<br />
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows<br />
No you'll not now or no other day<br />
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache?br&gt; and inside it the people made of molasses<br />
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses<br />
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies<br />
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny<br />
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack<br />
And before you can count from one to ten<br />
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back<br />
My friend<br />
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl<br />
And play games with each other in their sand-box world<br />
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools<br />
That run around gallant<br />
And make all rules for the ones that got talent<br />
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do<br />
And think they're foolin' you<br />
The ones who jump on the wagon<br />
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style<br />
To get their kicks, get out of it quick<br />
And make all kinds of rnoney and chicks<br />
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat<br />
Sayin', &quot;christ do i gotta be like that<br />
Ain't there no one here that knows where i'm at<br />
Ain't there no one here that knows how i feel<br />
Good god almighty<br />
That stuff ain't real&quot;<br />
<br />
No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race<br />
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face<br />
You gotta look some other place<br />
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'<br />
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'<br />
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'<br />
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'<br />
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there<br />
And out there somewhere<br />
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads<br />
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows<br />
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways<br />
You can touch and twist<br />
And turn two kinds of doorknobs<br />
You can either go to the church of your choice<br />
Or you can go to brooklyn state hospital<br />
You'll find god in the church of your choice<br />
You'll find woody guthrie in brooklyn state hospital<br />
<br />
And though it's only my opinion<br />
I may be right or wrong<br />
You'll find them both<br />
In the grand canyon<br />
At sundown<br />
