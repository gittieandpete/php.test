They say &quot;drink and be merry,<br />
Take the bull by the horns.&quot;<br />
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns<br />
Everything looks a little far away to me<br />
<br />
Gettin' harder and harder to recognize the trap<br />
Too much information about nothin'<br />
Too much educated rap<br />
It's just like you told me, just like you said it would be<br />
<br />
The moon rising like wildfire<br />
I feel the breath of a storm<br />
Something i got to do tonight<br />
You go inside and stay warm<br />
<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
You-<br />
Yeah, you got a hold of my heart<br />
<br />
Just got back from a city of powder blue skies<br />
Everybody thinks with their stomach<br />
There's plenty of spies<br />
Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear<br />
<br />
Madame butterfly, she lulls me to sleep<br />
Like an ancient river<br />
So wide and deep<br />
She said, &quot;be easy, baby, ain't nothin' worth stealin' here&quot;<br />
<br>
<br />
You're the one i've been waitin' for<br />
You're the one i desire<br />
But you must first realize<br />
I'm not another man for hire<br />
<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
You, you, you, you<br />
Yeah, you got a hold of my heart<br />
<br />
I hear the hot-blooded singer<br />
On the bandstand croon<br />
September song, memphis in june<br />
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a flaming red wig<br />
<br />
I been to babylon<br />
I gotta confess<br />
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness<br />
What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big<br />
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine<br />
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.<br />
<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
You-<br />
Yeah, you got a hold of my heart<br />
