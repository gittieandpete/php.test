Well, i was feelin' sad and feelin' blue,<br />
I didn't know what in the world i was gonna do,<br />
Them communists they wus comin' around,<br />
They wus in the air,<br />
They wus on the ground.<br />
They wouldn't gimme no peace. . .<br />
<br />
So i run down most hurriedly<br />
And joined up with the john birch society,<br />
I got me a secret membership card<br />
And started off a-walkin' down the road.<br />
Yee-hoo, i'm a real john bircher now!<br />
Look out you commies!<br />
<br />
Now we all agree with hitlers' views,<br />
Although he killed six million jews.<br />
It don't matter too much that he was a fascist,<br />
At least you can't say he was a communist!<br />
That's to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria.<br />
<br />
Well, i wus lookin' everywhere for them gol-darned reds.<br />
I got up in the mornin' 'n' looked under my bed,<br />
Looked in the sink, behind the door,<br />
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.<br />
Couldn't find 'em . . .<br />
<br />
I wus lookin' high an' low for them reds everywhere,<br />
I wus lookin' in the sink an' underneath the chair.<br />
I looked way up my chimney hole,<br />
I even looked deep inside my toilet bowl.<br />
They got away . . .<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, i wus sittin' home alone an' started to sweat,<br />
Figured they wus in my t.v. set.<br />
Peeked behind the picture frame,<br />
Got a shock from my feet, hittin' right up in the brain.<br />
Them reds caused it!<br />
I know they did . . . them hard-core ones.<br />
<br />
Well, i quit my job so i could work alone,<br />
Then i changed my name to sherlock holmes.<br />
Followed some clues from my detective bag<br />
And discovered they wus red stripes on the american flag!<br />
That ol' betty ross . . .<br />
<br />
Well, i investigated all the books in the library,<br />
Ninety percent of 'em gotta be burned away.<br />
I investigated all the people that i knowed,<br />
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go.<br />
The other two percent are fellow birchers . . . just like me.<br />
<br />
Now eisenhower, he's a russian spy,<br />
Lincoln, jefferson and that roosevelt guy.<br />
To my knowledge there's just one man<br />
That's really a true american: george lincoln rockwell.<br />
I know for a fact he hates commies cus he picketed the movie exodus.<br />
<br />
Well, i fin'ly started thinkin' straight<br />
When i run outa things to investigate.<br />
Couldn't imagine doin' anything else,<br />
So now i'm sittin' home investigatin' myself!<br />
Hope i don't find out anything . . . hmm, great god!<br />
