Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,<br />
I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.<br />
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street<br />
And then i turn my head, for you're approachin' me.<br />
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room<br />
With a golden loom.<br />
<br />
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine<br />
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.<br />
I see the hungry clouds up above your face<br />
<br>
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.<br />
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom<br />
With your golden loom.<br />
<br />
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light<br />
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.<br />
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail<br />
And then i kiss your lips as i lift your veil.<br />
But you're gone and then all i seem to recall is the smell of perfume<br />
And your golden loom.<br />
