Well, i walked all night long<br />
Listenin' to them church bells tone<br />
Yes, i walked all night long<br />
Listenin' to them church bells tone<br />
Either someone needing mercy<br />
Or maybe something i've done wrong<br />
<br />
Well, your friends come by for you<br />
I don't know what to say<br />
Well, your friends come by for you<br />
I don't know what to say<br />
I just can't face up to tell 'em<br />
Honey, you just went away<br />
<br />
Well, children cry for mother<br />
I tell them, &quot;mother took a trip&quot;<br />
Well, children cry for mother<br />
I tell them, &quot;mother took a trip&quot;<br />
Well, i walk on pins and needles<br />
I hope my tongue don't slip<br />
<br />
Well, i gaze at passing strangers<br />
In case i might see you<br />
Yes, i gaze at passing strangers<br />
<br>
In case i might see you<br />
But the sun goes around the heavens<br />
And another day just drives on through<br />
<br />
Way out in the distance<br />
I know you're with some other man<br />
Way out in the distance<br />
I know you're with some other man<br />
But that's alright, baby<br />
You know i always understand<br />
<br />
Call girls in the doorway<br />
All giving me the eye<br />
Call girls in the doorway<br />
All giving me the eye<br />
But my heart's just not in it<br />
I might as well pass right on by<br />
<br />
My ears are ringin'<br />
Ringin' like empty shells<br />
My ears are ringin'<br />
Ringin' like empty shells<br />
Well, it can't be no guitar player<br />
It must be convent bells<br />
