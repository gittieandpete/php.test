Who killed davey moore,<br />
Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
<br />
&quot;not i,&quot; says the referee,<br />
&quot;don't point your finger at me.<br />
I could've stopped it in the eighth<br />
An' maybe kept him from his fate,<br />
But the crowd would've booed, i'm sure,<br />
At not gettin' their money's worth.<br />
It's too bad he had to go,<br />
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.<br />
It wasn't me that made him fall.<br />
No, you can't blame me at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Who killed davey moore,<br />
Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
<br />
&quot;not us,&quot; says the angry crowd,<br />
Whose screams filled the arena loud.<br />
&quot;it's too bad he died that night<br />
But we just like to see a fight.<br />
We didn't mean for him t' meet his death,<br />
We just meant to see some sweat,<br />
There ain't nothing wrong in that.<br />
It wasn't us that made him fall.<br />
No, you can't blame us at all.&quot;<br />

Who killed davey moore,<br />
Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
<br />
&quot;not me,&quot; says his manager,<br />
Puffing on a big cigar.<br />
&quot;it's hard to say, it's hard to tell,<br />
I always thought that he was well.<br />
It's too bad for his wife an' kids he's dead,<br />
But if he was sick, he should've said.<br />
It wasn't me that made him fall.<br />
No, you can't blame me at all.&quot;<br />

Who killed davey moore,<br />
Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;not me,&quot; says the gambling man,<br />
With his ticket stub still in his hand.<br />
&quot;it wasn't me that knocked him down,<br />
My hands never touched him none.<br />
I didn't commit no ugly sin,<br />
Anyway, i put money on him to win.<br />
It wasn't me that made him fall.<br />
No, you can't blame me at all.&quot;<br />

Who killed davey moore,<br />
Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
<br />
&quot;not me,&quot; says the boxing writer,<br />
Pounding print on his old typewriter,<br />
Sayin', &quot;boxing ain't to blame,<br />
There's just as much danger in a football game.&quot;<br />
Sayin', &quot;fist fighting is here to stay,<br />
It's just the old american way.<br />
It wasn't me that made him fall.<br />
No, you can't blame me at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Who killed davey moore,<br />
Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
<br />
&quot;not me,&quot; says the man whose fists<br />
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,<br />
Who came here from cuba's door<br />
Where boxing ain't allowed no more.<br />
&quot;i hit him, yes, it's true,<br />
But that's what i am paid to do.<br />
Don't say 'murder,' don't say 'kill.'<br />
It was destiny, it was god's will.&quot;<br />
