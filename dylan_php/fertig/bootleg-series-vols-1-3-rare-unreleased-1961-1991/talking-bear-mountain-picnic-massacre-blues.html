I saw it advertised one day,<br />
Bear mountain picnic was comin' my way.<br />
&quot;come along 'n' take a trip,<br />
We'll bring you up there on a ship.<br />
Bring the wife and kids<br />
Bring the whole family.&quot;<br />
Yippee!<br />
<br />
Well, i run right down 'n' bought a ticket<br />
To this bear mountain picnic.<br />
But little did i realize<br />
I was in for a picnic surprise.<br />
Had nothin' to do with mountains.<br />
I didn't even come close to a bear.<br />
<br />
Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier,<br />
Six thousand people there,<br />
Everybody had ticket for the trip.<br />
&quot;oh well.&quot; i said, &quot;it's a pretty big ship.<br />
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think,<br />
That big old boat started t' sink<br />
More people kept a-pilin' on,<br />
That old ship was a-slowly goin' down.<br />
Funny way t' start a picnic.<br />
<br />
Well, i soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife,<br />
So many people there i never saw in m' life<br />
That old ship sinkin' down in the water,<br />
Six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other,<br />
Dogs a-barkin', cats a-meowin',<br />
<br>
Women screamin', fists a-flyin', babies cryin',<br />
Cops a-comin', me a-runnin'.<br />
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.<br />
<br />
I got shoved down 'n' pushed around,<br />
All i could hear there was a screamin' sound,<br />
Don't remember one thing more,<br />
Just remember walkin' up on a little shore,<br />
Head busted, stomach cracked,<br />
Feet splintered, i was bald, naked. . .<br />
Quite lucky to be alive though.<br />
<br />
Feelin' like i climbed outa m' casket,<br />
I grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket.<br />
Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home,<br />
Wishin' i'd never got up that morn.<br />
<br />
Now, i don't care just what you do,<br />
If you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you.<br />
But don't tell me about it, i don't wanta hear it,<br />
'cause, see, i just lost all m' picnic spirit.<br />
Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic. . .<br />
In the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny<br />
What some people are gonna do f'r money.<br />
There's a bran' new gimmick every day<br />
Just t' take somebody's money away.<br />
I think we oughta take some o' these people<br />
And put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to bear mountain . . .<br />
For a picnic.<br />
