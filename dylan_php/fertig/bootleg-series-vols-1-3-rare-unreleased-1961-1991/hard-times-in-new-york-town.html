Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song.<br />
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong.<br />
Just a little glimpse of a story i'll tell<br />
&quot;bout an east coast city that you all know well.<br />
It's hard times in the city,<br />
Livin' down in new york town.<br />
<br />
Old new york city is a friendly old town,<br />
From washington heights to harlem on down.<br />
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,<br />
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.<br />
It's hard times in the city,<br />
Livin' down in new york town.<br />
<br />
It's a mighty long ways from the golden gate<br />
To rockefeller plaza n' the empire state.<br />
Mister rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,<br />
Old mister empire never says a word.<br />
It's hard times from the country,<br />
Livin' down in new york town.<br />
<br />
Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.<br />
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.<br />
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,<br />
<br>
If you only got a nickel, it's the staten island ferry.<br />
And it's hard times in the city,<br />
Livin' down in new york town.<br />
<br />
Mister hudson come a-sailin' down the stream<br />
And old mister minuet paid for his dream.<br />
Bought your city on a one-way track,<br />
'f i had my way i'd sell it right back.<br />
And it's hard times in the city,<br />
Livin' down in new york town.<br />
<br />
I'll take all the smog in cal-i-for-ne-ay,<br />
'n' every bit of dust in the oklahoma plains,<br />
'n' the dirt in the caves of the rocky mountain mines.<br />
It's all much cleaner than the new york kind.<br />
And it's hard times in the city,<br />
Livin' down in new york town.<br />
<br />
So all you newsy people, spread the news around,<br />
You c'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.<br />
You c'n step on my name, you c'n try 'n' get me beat,<br />
When i leave new york, i'll be standin' on my feet.<br />
And it's hard times in the city,<br />
Livin' down in new york town.<br />
