Look out across the fields, see me returning,<br />
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile.<br />
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,<br />
You've had time to think about it for a while.<br />
<br />
Well, i've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,<br />
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high.<br />
It won't matter who loves who,<br />
You'll love me or i'll love you<br />
When the night comes falling from the sky.<br />
<br />
I can see through your walls and i know you're hurting,<br />
Sorrow covers you up like a cape.<br />
Only yesterday i know that you've been flirting<br />
With disaster that you managed to escape.<br />
<br />
I can't provide for you no easy answers,<br />
Who are you that i should have to lie?<br />
You'll know all about it, love,<br />
It'll fit you like a glove<br />
When the night comes falling from the sky.<br />
<br />
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,<br />
You must have been protecting someone last time i called.<br />
I've never asked you for nothing you couldn't deliver,<br />
I've never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.<br />
<br />
<br>
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,<br />
For the love of a lousy buck, i've watched them die.<br />
Stick around, baby, we're not through,<br />
Don't look for me, i'll see you<br />
When the night comes falling from the sky.<br />
<br />
In your teardrops, i can see my own reflection,<br />
It was on the northern border of texas where i crossed the line.<br />
I don't want to be a fool starving for affection,<br />
I don't want to drown in someone else's wine.<br />
<br />
For all eternity i think i will remember<br />
That icy wind that's howling in your eye.<br />
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind<br />
When the night comes falling from the sky.<br />
<br />
Well, i sent you my feelings in a letter<br />
But you were gambling for support.<br />
This time tomorrow i'll know you better<br />
When my memory is not so short.<br />
<br />
This time i'm asking for freedom,<br />
Freedom from a world which you deny.<br />
And you'll give it to me now,<br />
I'll take it anyhow<br />
When the night comes falling from the sky.<br />
