For his age, he's wise<br />
He's got his mother's eyes<br />
There's gladness in his heart<br />
He's young and he's wild<br />
My only prayer is, if i can't be there,<br />
Lord, protect my child<br />
<br />
As his youth now unfolds<br />
He is centuries old<br />
Just to see him at play makes me smile<br />
No matter what happens to me<br />
No matter what my destiny<br />
Lord, protect my child<br />
<br />
While the world is asleep<br />
You can look at it and weep<br />
Few things you find are worthwhile<br />
<br>
And though i don't ask for much<br />
No material things to touch<br />
Lord, protect my child<br />
<br />
He's young and on fire<br />
Full of hope and desire<br />
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled<br />
If i fall along the way<br />
And can't see another day<br />
Lord, protect my child<br />
<br />
There'll be a time i hear tell<br />
When all will be well<br />
When god and man will be reconciled<br />
But until men lose their chains<br />
And righteousness reigns<br />
Lord, protect my child<br />
