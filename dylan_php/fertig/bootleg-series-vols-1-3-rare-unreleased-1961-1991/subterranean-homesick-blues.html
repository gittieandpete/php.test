johnny's in the basement<br />
Mixing up the medicine<br />
I'm on the pavement<br />
Thinking about the government<br />
The man in the trench coat<br />
Badge out, laid off<br />
Says he's got a bad cough<br />
Wants to get it paid off<br />
Look out kid<br />
It's somethin' you did<br />
God knows when<br />
But you're doin' it again<br />
You better duck down the alley way<br />
Lookin' for a new friend<br />
The man in the coon-skin cap<br />
In the big pen<br />
Wants eleven dollar bills<br />
You only got ten<br />
<br />
Maggie comes fleet foot<br />
Face full of black soot<br />
Talkin' that the heat put<br />
Plants in the bed but<br />
The phone's tapped anyway<br />
Maggie says that many say<br />
They must bust in early may<br />
Orders from the d. a.<br />
Look out kid<br />
Don't matter what you did<br />
Walk on your tip toes<br />
Don't try &quot;no doz&quot;<br />
Better stay away from those<br />
That carry around a fire hose<br />
Keep a clean nose<br />
Watch the plain clothes<br />
You don't need a weather man<br />
To know which way the wind blows<br />
<br>
<br />
Get sick, get well<br />
Hang around a ink well<br />
Ring bell, hard to tell<br />
If anything is goin' to sell<br />
Try hard, get barred<br />
Get back, write braille<br />
Get jailed, jump bail<br />
Join the army, if you fail<br />
Look out kid<br />
You're gonna get hit<br />
But losers, cheaters<br />
Six-time users<br />
Hang around the theaters<br />
Girl by the whirlpool<br />
Lookin' for a new fool<br />
Don't follow leaders<br />
Watch the parkin' meters<br />
<br />
Ah get born, keep warm<br />
Short pants, romance, learn to dance<br />
Get dressed, get blessed<br />
Try to be a success<br />
Please her, please him, buy gifts<br />
Don't steal, don't lift<br />
Twenty years of schoolin'<br />
And they put you on the day shift<br />
Look out kid<br />
They keep it all hid<br />
Better jump down a manhole<br />
Light yourself a candle<br />
Don't wear sandals<br />
Try to avoid the scandals<br />
Don't wanna be a bum<br />
You better chew gum<br />
The pump don't work<br />
'cause the vandals took the handles<br />
