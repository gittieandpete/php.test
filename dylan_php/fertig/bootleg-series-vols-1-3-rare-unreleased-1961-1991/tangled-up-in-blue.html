Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',<br />
I was layin' in bed<br />
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all<br />
If her hair was still red.<br />
Her folks they said our lives together<br />
Sure was gonna be rough<br />
They never did like mama's homemade dress<br />
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.<br />
And i was standin' on the side of the road<br />
Rain fallin' on my shoes<br />
Heading out for the east coast<br />
Lord knows i've paid some dues gettin' through,<br />
Tangled up in blue.<br />
<br />
She was married when we first met<br />
Soon to be divorced<br />
I helped her out of a jam, i guess,<br />
But i used a little too much force.<br />
We drove that car as far as we could<br />
Abandoned it out west<br />
Split up on a dark sad night<br />
Both agreeing it was best.<br />
She turned around to look at me<br />
As i was walkin' away<br />
I heard her say over my shoulder,<br />
&quot;we'll meet again someday on the avenue,&quot;<br />
Tangled up in blue.<br />
<br />
I had a job in the great north woods<br />
Working as a cook for a spell<br />
But i never did like it all that much<br />
And one day the ax just fell.<br />
So i drifted down to new orleans<br />
Where i happened to be employed<br />
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat<br />
Right outside of delacroix.<br />
But all the while i was alone<br />
The past was close behind,<br />
I seen a lot of women<br />
But she never escaped my mind, and i just grew<br />
Tangled up in blue.<br />
<br />
She was workin' in a topless place<br />
And i stopped in for a beer,<br />
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face<br />
In the spotlight so clear.<br />
And later on as the crowd thinned out<br />
I's just about to do the same,<br />
<br>
She was standing there in back of my chair<br />
Said to me, &quot;don't i know your name?&quot;<br />
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,<br />
She studied the lines on my face.<br />
I must admit i felt a little uneasy<br />
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,<br />
Tangled up in blue.<br />
<br />
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe<br />
&quot;i thought you'd never say hello,&quot; she said<br />
&quot;you look like the silent type.&quot;<br />
Then she opened up a book of poems<br />
And handed it to me<br />
Written by an italian poet<br />
From the thirteenth century.<br />
And every one of them words rang true<br />
And glowed like burnin' coal<br />
Pourin' off of every page<br />
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,<br />
Tangled up in blue.<br />
<br />
I lived with them on montague street<br />
In a basement down the stairs,<br />
There was music in the cafes at night<br />
And revolution in the air.<br />
Then he started into dealing with slaves<br />
And something inside of him died.<br />
She had to sell everything she owned<br />
And froze up inside.<br />
And when finally the bottom fell out<br />
I became withdrawn,<br />
The only thing i knew how to do<br />
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,<br />
Tangled up in blue.<br />
<br />
So now i'm goin' back again,<br />
I got to get to her somehow.<br />
All the people we used to know<br />
They're an illusion to me now.<br />
Some are mathematicians<br />
Some are carpenter's wives.<br />
Don't know how it all got started,<br />
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.<br />
But me, i'm still on the road<br />
Headin' for another joint<br />
We always did feel the same,<br />
We just saw it from a different point of view,<br />
Tangled up in blue.<br />
