Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man<br />
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male<br />
They sang &quot;danny boy&quot; at his funeral and the lord's prayer<br />
Preacher talking 'bout christ betrayed<br />
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up<br />
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground<br />
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up<br />
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down<br />
<br />
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
Ain't no goin' back<br />
<br />
Hear ya got a brother named james, don't forget faces or names<br />
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed<br />
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine<br />
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed<br />
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger<br />
And your fall by the sword love affair with erroll flynn<br />
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion<br />
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.<br />
<br />
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
Ain't no goin' back<br />
<br />
There's a retired businessman named red, cast down from heaven and he's out of his head<br />
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch<br />
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash<br />
He's not somebody that you play around with much<br />
Miss delilah is his, a philistine is what she is<br />
She'll do wondrous works with your fate<br />
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed<br />
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.<br />
<br />
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
Ain't no goin' back<br />
<br />
<br>
Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight<br />
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors<br />
How to enter into the gates of paradise<br />
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours<br />
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks<br />
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks<br />
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in<br />
Sing &quot;amazing grace&quot; all the way to the swiss banks<br />
<br />
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
Ain't no goin' back<br />
<br />
They got some beautiful people out there, man<br />
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue<br />
They got mystery written all over their forehead<br />
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young<br />
They don't believe in mercy<br />
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see<br />
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route<br />
Turn you into anything that they want you to be<br />
<br />
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
Ain't no goin' back<br />
<br />
Yes, i guess i loved him too<br />
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill<br />
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped<br />
Struck down by the strength of the will<br />
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid<br />
From now on, this'll be where you're from<br />
Let the dead bury the dead. your time will come<br />
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade<br />
<br />
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
Ain't no goin' back<br />
