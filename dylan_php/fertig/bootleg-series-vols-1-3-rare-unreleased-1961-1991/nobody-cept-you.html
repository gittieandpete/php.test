There's nothing 'round here i believe in<br />
'cept you, yeah you<br />
And there's nothing to me that's sacred<br />
'cept you, yeah you<br />
<br />
You're the one that reaches me<br />
You're the one that i admire<br />
Every time we meet together<br />
My soul feels like it's on fire<br />
Nothing matters to me<br />
And there's nothing i desire<br />
'cept you, yeah you<br />
<br />
Nothing 'round here i care to try for<br />
'cept you, yeah you<br />
Got nothing left to live or die for<br />
'cept you, yeah you<br />
<br />
There's a hymn i used to hear<br />
In the churches all the time<br />
Make me feel so good inside<br />
So peaceful, so sublime<br />
<br>
And there's nothing to remind me of that<br />
Old familiar chime<br />
'cept you, uh huh you<br />
<br />
Used to play in the cemetery<br />
Dance and sing and run when i was a child<br />
Never seemed strange<br />
But now i just pass mournfully by<br />
That place where the bones of life are piled<br />
I know somethin' has changed<br />
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me<br />
'cept you, yeah you<br />
<br />
Nothing much matters or seems to please me<br />
'cept you, yeah you<br />
Nothing hypnotizes me<br />
Or holds me in a spell<br />
Everything runs by me<br />
Just like water from a well<br />
Everybody wants my attention<br />
Ev'rybody's got something to sell<br />
'cept you, yeah you<br />
