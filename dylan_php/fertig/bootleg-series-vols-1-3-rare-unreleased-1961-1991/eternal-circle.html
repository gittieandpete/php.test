I sang the song slowly<br />
As she stood in the shadows<br />
She stepped to the light<br />
As my silver strings spun<br />
She called with her eyes<br />
To the tune i's a-playin'<br />
But the song it was long<br />
And i'd only begun<br />
<br />
Through a bullet of light<br />
Her face was reflectin'<br />
The fast fading words<br />
That rolled from my tongue<br />
With a long-distance look<br />
Her eyes was on fire<br />
But the song it was long<br />
And there was more to be sung.<br />
<br />
My eyes danced a circle<br />
Across her clear outline<br />
With her head tilted sideways<br />
She called me again<br />
<br>
As the tune drifted out<br />
She breathed hard through the echo<br />
But the song it was long<br />
And it was far to the end<br />
<br />
I glanced at my guitar<br />
And played it pretendin'<br />
That of all the eyes out there<br />
I could see none<br />
As her thoughts pounded hard<br />
Like the pierce of an arrow<br />
But the song it was long<br />
And it had to get done<br />
<br />
As the tune finally folded<br />
I laid down the guitar<br />
Then looked for the girl<br />
Who'd stayed for so long<br />
But her shadow was missin'<br />
For all of my searchin'<br />
So i picked up my guitar<br />
And began the next song<br />
