You changed my life<br />
Came along in a time of strife<br />
In hunger and need<br />
You made my heart bleed<br />
You changed my life<br />
You changed my life<br />
<br />
Now the nature of man<br />
Is to beg and to steal<br />
I'd do it myself<br />
It's not so unreal<br />
The call of the wild's<br />
Forever at my door<br />
Want me to fly like an eagle<br />
Being chained to the floor, but<br />
<br />
You changed my life<br />
Came along in a time of strife<br />
In hunger and need<br />
You made my heart bleed<br />
You changed my life<br />
You changed my life<br />
<br />
Eating with the pigs<br />
Off a fancy tray<br />
I was bold, i was looking good<br />
And to have a nice day<br />
It all seemed so proper<br />
And so elite<br />
Eating absolute garbage<br />
While being so discreet.<br />
<br />
You changed my life<br />
Came along in a time of strife<br />
In hunger and need<br />
<br>
You made my heart bleed<br />
You changed my life<br />
You changed my life<br />
<br />
You were glowing in the light<br />
Being peaceably calm<br />
Well, how often does a man dance<br />
To the beat of the balm?<br />
Your eyes were on fire<br />
Your feet were of brass<br />
In a world that you made<br />
You were an outcast<br />
<br />
You changed my life<br />
Came along in a time of strife<br />
In hunger and need<br />
You made my heart bleed<br />
You changed my life<br />
You changed my life<br />
<br />
Truce makers and partakers<br />
Of every selfish whim<br />
Her running to meet me running to her<br />
And you running back to him<br />
Their destruction of my confidence<br />
Was like a sharpness of the tongue<br />
I said: make my faith greater<br />
But i was a little high strung<br />
<br />
You changed my life<br />
Came along in a time of strife<br />
In hunger and need<br />
You made my heart bleed<br />
You changed my life<br />
You changed my life<br />
