He was a friend of mine<br />
He was a friend of mine<br />
Every time i think about him now<br />
Lord i just can't keep from cryin'<br />
'cause he was a friend of mine<br />
<br />
He died on the road<br />
He died on the road<br />
He never had enough money<br />
To pay his room or board<br />
And he was a friend of mine<br />
<br />
I stole away and cried<br />
I stole away and cried<br />
'cause i never had too much money<br />
<br>
And i never been quite satisfied<br />
And he was a friend of mine<br />
<br />
He never done no wrong<br />
He never done no wrong<br />
A thousand miles from home<br />
And he never harmed no one<br />
And he was a friend of mine<br />
<br />
He was a friend of mine<br />
He was a friend of mine<br />
Every time i hear his name<br />
Lord i just can't keep from cryin'<br />
'cause he was a friend of mine.<br />
