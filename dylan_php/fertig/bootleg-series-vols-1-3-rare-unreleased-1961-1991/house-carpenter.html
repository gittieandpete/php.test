Well met, well met, my own true love<br />
Well met, well met, cried she<br />
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea<br />
And it's all for the love of thee<br />
<br />
I could have married a king's daughter there<br />
She would have married me<br />
But i have forsaken my king's daughter there<br />
It's all for the love of thee<br />
<br />
Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there<br />
I'm sure you're the one to blame<br />
For i am married to a house carpenter<br />
And i'm sure he's a fine young man<br />
<br />
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter<br />
And come away with me<br />
I'll take you where the green grass grows<br />
On the shores of sunny italy<br />
<br />
So up she picked her babies three<br />
And gave them kisses, one, two, three<br />
Saying &quot;take good care of your daddy while i'm gone<br />
And keep him good company.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br>
Well, they were sailin' about two weeks<br />
I'm sure it was not three<br />
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck<br />
Sayin' she wants company<br />
<br />
&quot;well, are you weepin' for your house and home?<br />
Or are you weepin' for your babies three?&quot;<br />
&quot;well, i'm not weepin' for my house carpenter<br />
I'm weepin' for my babies three.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love<br />
They look as white as snow<br />
Those are the hill of heaven, my love<br />
You and i'll never know<br />
<br />
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love<br />
They look as dark as night<br />
Those are the hills of hell-fire my love<br />
Where you and i will unite<br />
<br />
Oh twice around went the gallant ship<br />
I'm sure it was not three<br />
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak<br />
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea<br />
