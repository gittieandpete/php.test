The pawnbroker roared<br />
Also, so, so did the landlord<br />
The scene was so crazy, wasn't it?<br />
Both were so glad<br />
To watch me destroy what i had<br />
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?<br />
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?<br />
Why'd you have to treat me so bad?<br />
Did it have to be that way?<br />
Now you stand here expectin' me to remember somethin' you forgot to say<br />
Yes, and you, i see you're still with her, well<br />
That's fine 'cause she's comin' on so strange, can't you tell?<br />
Somebody had better explain<br />
She's got her iron chain<br />
I'd do it, but i, i just can't remember how<br />
You talk to her<br />
She's your lover now.<br />
<br />
I already assumed<br />
That we're in the felony room<br />
But i ain't a judge, you don't have to be nice to me<br />
But please tell that<br />
To your friend in the cowboy hat<br />
You know he keeps on sayin' ev'rythin' twice to me<br />
You know i was straight with you<br />
You know i've never tried to change you in any way<br />
You know if you didn't want to be with me<br />
<br>
That you could . . . didn't have to stay.<br />
Now you stand here sayin' you forgive and forget. honey, what can i say?<br />
Yes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can't you reach?<br />
I see you kiss her on the cheek ev'rytime she gives a speech<br />
With her picture books of the pyramid<br />
And her postcards of billy the kid<br />
(why must everybody bow?)<br />
You better talk to her 'bout it<br />
You're her lover now.<br />
<br />
Oh, ev'rybody that cares<br />
Is goin' up the castle stairs<br />
But i'm not up in your castle, honey<br />
It's true, i just can't recall<br />
San francisco at all<br />
I can't even remember el paso, uh, honey<br />
You never had to be faithful<br />
I didn't want you to grieve<br />
Oh, why was it so hard for you<br />
If you didn't want to be with me, just to leave?<br />
Now you stand here while your finger's goin' up my sleeve<br />
An' you, just what do you do anyway? ain't there nothin' you can say?<br />
She'll be standin' on the bar soon<br />
With a fish head an' a harpoon<br />
An' a fake beard plastered on her brow<br />
You'd better do somethin' quick<br />
She's your lover now.<br />
