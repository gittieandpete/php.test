It's been raining in the trenches all day long, dripping down to my clothes,<br />
My patience is wearing thin, got a fire inside my nose.<br />
Searching for the truth the way god designed it,<br />
The truth is i might drown before i find it.<br />
<br />
Well i need a woman, yes i do<br />
Need a woman, yes i do.<br />
Someone who can see me as i am,<br />
Somebody who just don't give a damn.<br />
And i want you to be that woman every night,<br />
Be that woman.<br />
<br />
I've had my eyes on you baby for about five long years,<br />
You probably don't know me at all, but i have seen your laughter and tears.<br />
Now you don't frighten me, my heart is jumping<br />
And you look like it wouldn't hurt you none to have a man who could give ya something.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well i need a woman, oh don't i<br />
Need a woman, bring it home safe at last.<br />
Seen you turn the corner, seen your bootheels spark,<br />
Seen you in the daylight, and watched you in the dark.<br />
And i want you to be that woman, all right<br />
Be that woman every night.<br />
<br />
Well, if you believe in something long enough you just naturally come to think it's true.<br />
There ain't no wall you can't cross over, ain't no fire you can't walk through.<br />
Well, believing is all right, just don't let the wrong people know what it's all about.<br />
They might put the evil eye on you, use their hidden powers to try to turn you out.<br />
<br />
Well i need a woman, just to be my queen.<br />
Need a woman, know what i mean?<br />
