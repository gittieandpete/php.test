Old reilly stole a stallion<br />
But they caught him and they brought him back<br />
And they laid him down on the jailhouse ground<br />
With an iron chain around his neck.<br />
<br />
Old reilly's daughter got a message<br />
That her father was goin' to hang.<br />
She rode by night and came by morning<br />
With gold and silver in her hand.<br />
<br />
When the judge he saw reilly's daughter<br />
His old eyes deepened in his head,<br />
Sayin', &quot;gold will never free your father,<br />
The price, my dear, is you instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;oh i'm as good as dead,&quot; cried reilly,<br />
&quot;it's only you that he does crave<br />
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all.<br />
Get on your horse and ride away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;oh father you will surely die<br />
If i don't take the chance to try<br />
<br>
And pay the price and not take your advice.<br />
For that reason i will have to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gallows shadows shook the evening,<br />
In the night a hound dog bayed,<br />
In the night the grounds were groanin',<br />
In the night the price was paid.<br />
<br />
The next mornin' she had awoken<br />
To know that the judge had never spoken.<br />
She saw that hangin' branch a-bendin',<br />
She saw her father's body broken.<br />
<br />
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:<br />
That one doctor will not save him,<br />
That two healers will not heal him,<br />
That three eyes will not see him.<br />
<br />
That four ears will not hear him,<br />
That five walls will not hide him,<br />
That six diggers will not bury him<br />
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.<br />
