You harbor resentment<br />
You know there ain't too much of a thrill<br />
You wish for contentment<br />
But you got an emptiness that can't be filled<br />
You've had enough hatred<br />
Your bones are breaking (and you) can't find nothing sacred, (but)<br />
<br />
Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed<br />
In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows<br />
The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths<br />
And ye shall be changed<br />
<br />
Everything you've gotten<br />
You've gotten by sweat, blood and muscle<br />
From early in the morning 'til way past dark<br />
All you ever do is hustle<br />
All your loved ones have walked out the door<br />
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more, but<br />
<br />
Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed<br />
In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows<br />
The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths<br />
And ye shall be changed<br />
<br />
<br>
(now) the past don't control you<br />
But the future's like a roulette wheel spinning<br />
(and) deep down inside<br />
You know you need a whole new beginning<br />
Don't have to go to russia or iran<br />
Just surrender to god and he'll move you right here where you stand, and<br />
<br />
Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed<br />
In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows<br />
The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths<br />
And ye shall be changed<br />
<br />
You drink bitter water<br />
And you been eating the bread of sorrow<br />
You can't live for today<br />
When all you're ever thinking of is tomorrow<br />
The path you've endured has been rough<br />
And when you've decided that you've had enough, then<br />
<br />
Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed<br />
In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows<br />
The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths<br />
And ye shall be changed<br />
