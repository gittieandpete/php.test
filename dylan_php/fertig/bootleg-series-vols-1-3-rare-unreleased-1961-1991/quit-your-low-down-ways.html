Oh, you can read out your bible,<br />
You can fall down on your knees, pretty mama,<br />
And pray to the lord<br />
But it ain't gonna do no good.<br />
<br />
You're gonna need<br />
You're gonna need my help someday<br />
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'<br />
Please quit your low down ways.<br />
<br />
Well, you can run down to the white house,<br />
You can gaze at the capitol dome, pretty mama,<br />
You can pound on the president's gate<br />
But you oughta know by now it's gonna be too late.<br />
<br />
You're gonna need<br />
You're gonna need my help someday<br />
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'<br />
Please quit your low down ways.<br />
<br />
Well, you can run down to the desert,<br />
Throw yourself on the burning sand.<br />
You can raise up your right hand, pretty mama,<br />
But you better understand you done lost your one good man.<br />
<br />
<br>
You're gonna need<br />
You're gonna need my help someday<br />
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'<br />
Please quit your low down ways.<br />
<br />
And you can hitchhike on the highway,<br />
You can stand all alone by the side of the road.<br />
You can try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,<br />
But you can't ride in my car no more.<br />
<br />
You're gonna need<br />
You're gonna need my help someday<br />
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'<br />
Please quit your low down ways.<br />
<br />
Oh, you can read out your bible,<br />
You can fall down on your knees, pretty mama,<br />
And pray to the lord<br />
But it ain't gonna do no good.<br />
<br />
You're gonna need<br />
You're gonna need my help someday<br />
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'<br />
Please quit your low down ways.<br />
