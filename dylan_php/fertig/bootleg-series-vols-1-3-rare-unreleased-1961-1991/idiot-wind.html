Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press<br />
Whoever it is i wish they'd cut it out but when they will i can only guess.<br />
They say i shot a man named gray and took his wife to italy,<br />
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.<br />
I can't help it if i'm lucky.<br />
<br />
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act<br />
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.<br />
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,<br />
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that<br />
Sweet lady.<br />
<br />
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,<br />
Blowing down the backroads headin' south.<br />
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,<br />
You're an idiot, babe.<br />
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.<br />
<br />
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike<br />
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long i can't remember what it's like.<br />
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,<br />
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars<br />
After losin' every battle.<br />
<br />
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are<br />
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars.<br />
You hurt the ones that i love best and cover up the truth with lies.<br />
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,<br />
Blood on your saddle.<br />
<br />
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,<br />
Blowing through the curtains in your room.<br />
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,<br />
You're an idiot, babe.<br />
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.<br />
<br />
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart<br />
<br>
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.<br />
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped,<br />
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top<br />
You're on the bottom.<br />
<br />
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind<br />
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes<br />
Don't look into mine.<br />
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building<br />
Burned.<br />
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime<br />
Turned slowly into autumn.<br />
<br />
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,<br />
From the grand coulee dam to the capitol.<br />
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,<br />
You're an idiot, babe.<br />
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.<br />
<br />
I can't feel you anymore, i can't even touch the books you've read<br />
Every time i crawl past your door, i been wishin' i was somebody else instead.<br />
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,<br />
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory<br />
And all your ragin' glory.<br />
<br />
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now i'm finally free,<br />
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.<br />
You'll never know the hurt i suffered nor the pain i rise above,<br />
And i'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,<br />
And it makes me feel so sorry.<br />
<br />
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,<br />
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.<br />
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,<br />
We're idiots, babe.<br />
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.<br />
