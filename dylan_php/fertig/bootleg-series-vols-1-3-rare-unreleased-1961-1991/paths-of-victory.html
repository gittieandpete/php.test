Trails of troubles,<br />
Roads of battles,<br />
Paths of victory,<br />
I shall walk.<br />
<br />
The trail is dusty<br />
And my road it might be rough,<br />
But the better roads are waiting<br />
And boys it ain't far off.<br />
<br />
Trails of troubles,<br />
Roads of battles,<br />
Paths of victory,<br />
We shall walk.<br />
<br />
I walked down by the river,<br />
I turned my head up high.<br />
I saw that silver linin'<br />
That was hangin' in the sky.<br />
<br />
Trails of troubles,<br />
Roads of battles,<br />
Paths of victory,<br />
We shall walk.<br />
<br />
The evenin' dusk was rollin',<br />
I was walking down the track.<br />
There was a one-way wind a-blowin'<br />
And it was blowin' at my back.<br />
<br />
Trails of troubles,<br />
Roads of battles,<br />
<br>
Paths of victory,<br />
We shall walk.<br />
<br />
The gravel road is bumpy,<br />
It's a hard road to ride,<br />
But there's a clearer road a-waitin'<br />
With the cinders on the side.<br />
<br />
Trails of troubles,<br />
Roads of battles,<br />
Paths of victory,<br />
We shall walk.<br />
<br />
That evening train was rollin',<br />
The hummin' of its wheels,<br />
My eyes they saw a better day<br />
As i looked across the fields.<br />
<br />
Trails of troubles,<br />
Roads of battles,<br />
Paths of victory,<br />
We shall walk.<br />
<br />
The trail is dusty,<br />
The road it might be rough,<br />
But the good road is a-waitin'<br />
And boys it ain't far off.<br />
<br />
Trails of troubles,<br />
Roads of battles,<br />
Paths of victory,<br />
We shall walk.<br />
