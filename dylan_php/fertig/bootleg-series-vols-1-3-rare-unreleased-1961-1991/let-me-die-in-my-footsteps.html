I will not go down under the ground<br />
&quot;cause somebody tells me that death's comin' 'round<br />
An' i will not carry myself down to die<br />
When i go to my grave my head will be high,<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before i go down under the ground.<br />
<br />
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been<br />
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind<br />
And some people thinkin' that the end is close by<br />
&quot;stead of learnin' to live they are learning to die.<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before i go down under the ground.<br />
<br />
I don't know if i'm smart but i think i can see<br />
When someone is pullin' the wool over me<br />
And if this war comes and death's all around<br />
Let me die on this land 'fore i die underground.<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before i go down under the ground.<br />
<br />
There's always been people that have to cause fear<br />
They've been talking of the war now for many long years<br />
I have read all their statements and i've not said a word<br />
<br>
But now lawd god, let my poor voice be heard.<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before i go down under the ground.<br />
<br />
If i had rubies and riches and crowns<br />
I'd buy the whole world and change things around<br />
I'd throw all the guns and the tanks in the sea<br />
For they are mistakes of a past history.<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before i go down under the ground.<br />
<br />
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood<br />
Let me smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood<br />
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves<br />
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace.<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before i go down under the ground.<br />
<br />
Go out in your country where the land meets the sun<br />
See the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run<br />
Nevada, new mexico, arizona, idaho<br />
Let every state in this union seep in your souls.<br />
And you'll die in your footsteps<br />
Before you go down under the ground.<br />
