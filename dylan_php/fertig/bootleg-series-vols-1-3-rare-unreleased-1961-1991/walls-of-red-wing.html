Oh, the age of the inmates<br />
I remember quite freely:<br />
No younger than twelve,<br />
No older 'n seventeen.<br />
Thrown in like bandits<br />
And cast off like criminals,<br />
Inside the walls,<br />
The walls of red wing.<br />
<br />
From the dirty old mess hall<br />
You march to the brick wall,<br />
Too weary to talk<br />
And too tired to sing.<br />
Oh, it's all afternoon<br />
You remember your home town,<br />
Inside the walls,<br />
The walls of red wing.<br />
<br />
Oh, the gates are cast iron<br />
And the walls are barbed wire.<br />
Stay far from the fence<br />
With the 'lectricity sting.<br />
And it's keep down your head<br />
And stay in your number,<br />
Inside the walls,<br />
The walls of red wing.<br />
<br />
Oh, it's fare thee well<br />
To the deep hollow dungeon,<br />
Farewell to the boardwalk<br />
That takes you to the screen.<br />
And farewell to the minutes<br />
They threaten you with it,<br />
Inside the walls,<br />
The walls of red wing.<br />
<br>
<br />
It's many a guard<br />
That stands around smilin',<br />
Holdin' his club<br />
Like he was a king.<br />
Hopin' to get you<br />
Behind a wood pilin',<br />
Inside the walls,<br />
The walls of red wing.<br />
<br />
The night aimed shadows<br />
Through the crossbar windows,<br />
And the wind punched hard<br />
To make the wall-siding sing.<br />
It's many a night i pretended to be a-sleepin',<br />
Inside the walls,<br />
The walls of red wing.<br />
<br />
As the rain rattled heavy<br />
On the bunk-house shingles,<br />
And the sounds in the night,<br />
They made my ears ring.<br />
'til the keys of the guards<br />
Clicked the tune of the morning,<br />
Inside the walls,<br />
The walls of red wing.<br />
<br />
Oh, some of us'll end up<br />
In st. cloud prison,<br />
And some of us'll wind up<br />
To be lawyers and things,<br />
And some of us'll stand up<br />
To meet you on your crossroads,<br />
From inside the walls,<br />
The walls of red wing.<br />
