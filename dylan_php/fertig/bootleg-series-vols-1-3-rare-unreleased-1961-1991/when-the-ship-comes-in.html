Oh the time will come up<br />
When the winds will stop<br />
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'.<br />
Like the stillness in the wind<br />
'fore the hurricane begins,<br />
The hour when the ship comes in.<br />
<br />
Oh the seas will split<br />
And the ship will hit<br />
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking.<br />
Then the tide will sound<br />
And the wind will pound<br />
And the morning will be breaking.<br />
<br />
Oh the fishes will laugh<br />
As they swim out of the path<br />
And the seagulls they'll be smiling.<br />
And the rocks on the sand<br />
Will proudly stand,<br />
The hour that the ship comes in.<br />
<br />
And the words that are used<br />
For to get the ship confused<br />
Will not be understood as they're spoken.<br />
For the chains of the sea<br />
Will have busted in the night<br />
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean.<br />
<br />
<br>
A song will lift<br />
As the mainsail shifts<br />
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline.<br />
And the sun will respect<br />
Every face on the deck,<br />
The hour that the ship comes in.<br />
<br />
Then the sands will roll<br />
Out a carpet of gold<br />
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'.<br />
And the ship's wise men<br />
Will remind you once again<br />
That the whole wide world is watchin'.<br />
<br />
Oh the foes will rise<br />
With the sleep still in their eyes<br />
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'.<br />
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal<br />
And know that it's for real,<br />
The hour when the ship comes in.<br />
<br />
Then they'll raise their hands,<br />
Sayin' we'll meet all your demands,<br />
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered.<br />
And like pharaoh's tribe,<br />
They'll be drownded in the tide,<br />
And like goliath, they'll be conquered.<br />
