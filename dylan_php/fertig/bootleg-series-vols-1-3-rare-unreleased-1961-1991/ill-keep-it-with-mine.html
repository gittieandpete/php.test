You will search, babe,<br />
At any cost.<br />
But how long, babe,<br />
Can you search for what's not lost?<br />
Ev'rybody will help you,<br />
Some people are very kind.<br />
But if i can save you any time,<br />
Come on, give it to me,<br />
I'll keep it with mine.<br />
<br />
I can't help it<br />
If you might think i'm odd,<br />
If i say i'm not loving you for what you are<br />
But for what you're not.<br />
Everybody will help you<br />
<br>
Discover what you set out to find.<br />
But if i can save you any time,<br />
Come on, give it to me,<br />
I'll keep it with mine.<br />
<br />
The train leaves<br />
At half past ten,<br />
But it'll be back tomorrow,<br />
Same time again.<br />
The conductor he's weary,<br />
He's still stuck on the line.<br />
But if i can save you any time,<br />
Come on, give it to me,<br />
I'll keep it with mine.<br />
