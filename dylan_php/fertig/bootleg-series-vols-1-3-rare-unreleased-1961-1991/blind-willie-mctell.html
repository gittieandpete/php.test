Seen the arrow on the doorpost<br />
Saying, &quot;this land is condemned<br />
All the way from new orleans<br />
To jerusalem.&quot;<br />
I traveled through east texas<br />
Where many martyrs fell<br />
And i know no one can sing the blues<br />
Like blind willie mctell<br />
<br />
Well, i heard the hoot owl singing<br />
As they were taking down the tents<br />
The stars above the barren trees<br />
Were his only audience<br />
Them charcoal gypsy maidens<br />
Can strut their feathers well<br />
But nobody can sing the blues<br />
Like blind willie mctell<br />
<br />
See them big plantations burning<br />
Hear the cracking of the whips<br />
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming<br />
(and) see the ghosts of slavery ships<br />
<br>
I can hear them tribes a-moaning<br />
(i can) hear the undertaker's bell<br />
(yeah), nobody can sing the blues<br />
Like blind willie mctell<br />
<br />
There's a woman by the river<br />
With some fine young handsome man<br />
He's dressed up like a squire<br />
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand<br />
There's a chain gang on the highway<br />
I can hear them rebels yell<br />
And i know no one can sing the blues<br />
Like blind willie mctell<br />
<br />
Well, god is in heaven<br />
And we all want what's his<br />
But power and greed and corruptible seed<br />
Seem to be all that there is<br />
I'm gazing out the window<br />
Of the st. james hotel<br />
And i know no one can sing the blues<br />
Like blind willie mctell<br />
