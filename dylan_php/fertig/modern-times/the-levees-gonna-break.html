If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
Everybody saying this is a day only the Lord could make <br />
<br />
Well, I worked on the levee, mama, both night and day <br />
I worked on the levee, mama, both night and day <br />
I got to the river and I threw my clothes away <br />
<br />
I paid my time and now I'm good as new, <br />
I paid my time and now I'm as good as new. <br />
They can't take me back unless I want them to <br />
<br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
Some of these people gonna strip you of all they can take <br />
<br />
I can't stop here I ain't ready to unload <br />
I can't stop here I ain't ready to unload <br />
Riches and salvation can be waiting behind the next bend in the road <br />
<br />
I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get <br />
I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get <br />
You say you want me to quit you, I told you, 'No, not just yet.' <br />
<br />
Well, I look in your eyes, I see nobody other than me <br />
I look in your eyes, I see nobody other than me <br />
I see all that I am and all I hope to be <br />
<br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
Some of these people don't know which road to take <br />
<br>
<br />
When I'm with you, I forget I was ever blue <br />
When I'm with you, I forget I was ever blue <br />
Without you there's no meaning in anything I do <br />
<br />
Some people on the road carrying everything that they own <br />
Some people on the road carrying everything they own <br />
Some people got barely enough skin to cover their bones <br />
<br />
Put on your cat clothes, mama, put on your evening dress <br />
Put on your cat clothes, mama, put on your evening dress <br />
Few more years of hard work, then there'll be a 1,000 years of happiness <br />
<br />
If it keep on raining, the levee gonna break <br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
I tried to get you to love me, but I won't repeat that mistake <br />
<br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break <br />
Plenty of cheap stuff out there and still around that you take <br />
<br />
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed <br />
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed <br />
I ain't got enough room to even raise my head. <br />
<br />
Come back, baby, say we never more will part <br />
Come back, baby, say we never more will part <br />
Don't be a stranger with no brain or heart <br />
<br />
If it keep on raining, the levee's gonna break.<br />
<br />
