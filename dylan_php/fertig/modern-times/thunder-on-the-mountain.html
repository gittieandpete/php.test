Thunder on the mountain, and there's fires on the moon <br />
A ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon<br />
Today's the day, where I'm gonna grab my trombone and blow <br />
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go <br />
<br />
I was thinking about Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying <br />
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line <br />
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be <br />
I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee<br />
<br />
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand <br />
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand <br />
You brought me here, now you're trying to turn me away <br />
The writing on the wall, come read it, come see what it does say <br />
<br />
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum <br />
Going to sleep over there, that's where the music is coming from <br />
I don't need any guide, I already know the way <br />
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day <br />
<br />
The pistols are popping and the power is down <br />
I'd like to try something but I'm so far from town <br />
The sun keeps shining and the North Wind keeps picking up speed <br />
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need <br />
<br />
I've been sitting down studying the art of love <br />
I think it will fit me like a glove <br />
I want some real good woman to do just what I say <br />
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today <br />
<br />
<br>
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground <br />
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down <br />
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my King <br />
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing <br />
<br />
Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches <br />
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages <br />
I been to St. Herman's church, said my religious vows <br />
As I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows <br />
<br />
I've got the pork chops, she's got the pie <br />
She ain't no angel and neither am I <br />
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes <br />
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams <br />
<br />
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be <br />
Mean old twister bearing down on me <br />
All the ladies in Washington scrambling to get out of town <br />
Looks like something bad is going to happen, better roll your airplane down <br />
<br />
Everybody going and I want to go too <br />
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new <br />
I did all I could, I did it right there and then <br />
I've already confessed, no need to confess again <br />
<br />
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up North <br />
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth <br />
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf <br />
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself.<br />
<br />
