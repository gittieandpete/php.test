I don't care what you do, I don't care what you say <br />
I don't care where you go or how long you stay <br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me any more <br />
<br />
Well you take my money and you turn it out <br />
You fill me up with nothing but self doubt <br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me any more <br />
<br />
When I was young, driving was my crave <br />
You drive me so hard, almost to the grave <br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me any more <br />
<br />
I'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots <br />
I keep recycling the same old thoughts <br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me me any more <br />
<br />
So many good things in life that I've overlooked <br />
I don't know what to do now, you got me hooked <br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me me any more <br />
<br>
<br />
Well, I don't want to brag, but I'm gonna wring your neck <br />
When all else fails I'll make it a matter of self respect <br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me any more <br />
<br />
You can take your clothes put them em in a sack <br />
You're going down the road, baby and you can't come back <br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me any more <br />
<br />
I tried to be friendly, I tried to be kind <br />
I'm gonna drive you from your home, just like I was driven from mine <br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me any more <br />
<br />
Living this way ain't a natural thing to do <br />
Why was I born to love you? <br />
<br />
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry about me any more<br />
<br />
