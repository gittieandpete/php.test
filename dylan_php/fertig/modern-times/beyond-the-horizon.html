Beyond the horizon, behind the sun <br />
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun <br />
In the long hours of twilight underneath the stardust above <br />
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love <br />
<br />
I'm touched with desire <br />
What I do <br />
Through flame and through fire <br />
I'll build my world around you <br />
<br />
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or fall <br />
Love waits forever, for one and for all <br />
<br />
Beyond the horizon, across the divide <br />
Around about midnight, we'll be on the same side <br />
Down in the valley the water runs cold <br />
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul <br />
<br />
My wretched heart is pounding <br />
I felt an angel's kiss <br />
My memories are drowning <br />
In mortal bliss <br />
<br />
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game <br />
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same <br />
<br />
<br>
Beyond the horizon, the night winds blow <br />
The theme of a melody from many moons ago <br />
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime <br />
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time <br />
<br />
It's dark and it's dreary <br />
I've been pleading in vain <br />
I'm wounded, I'm weary <br />
My repentance is plain <br />
<br />
Beyond the horizon over the treacherous sea <br />
I still can't believe that you have set aside your love for me <br />
<br />
Beyond the horizon, underneath crimson skies <br />
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes <br />
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone <br />
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone <br />
<br />
It's the right time of the season <br />
Somebody there always cared <br />
There's always a reason <br />
Why some one's life has been spared <br />
<br />
Beyond the horizon, the sky is so blue <br />
I've got more than a lifetime to live loving you<br />
<br />
