In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light <br />
Where wisdom grows up in strife <br />
My bewildering brain, toils in vain <br />
Through the darkness on the pathways of life <br />
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air <br />
Tomorrow keeps turning around <br />
We live and we die, we know not why <br />
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down <br />
<br />
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think <br />
Far down the street we stray <br />
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by <br />
Things I never meant nor wished to say <br />
The midnight rain follows the train <br />
We all wear the same thorny crown <br />
Soul to soul, our shadows roll <br />
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down <br />
<br />
<br>
Well, the moon gives light and it shines by night <br />
When I scarcely feel the glow <br />
We learn to live and then we forgive <br />
Over the road we're bound to go <br />
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours <br />
That keep us so tightly bound <br />
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies <br />
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down <br />
<br />
Well, I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes <br />
I followed the winding stream <br />
I heard the deafening noise, I felt transient joys <br />
I know they're not what they seem <br />
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain <br />
You'll never see me frown <br />
I owe my heart to you, and that's saying it's true <br />
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down<br />
<br />
