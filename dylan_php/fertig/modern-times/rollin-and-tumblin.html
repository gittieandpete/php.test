I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long<br />
I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long<br />
Woke up this mornin', I must have bet my money wrong<br />
<br />
I got troubles so hard, I can't stand the strain<br />
I got troubles so hard, I can't stand the strain<br />
Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains<br />
<br />
The landscape is glowin', gleamin' in the golden light of day<br />
The landscape is glowin', gleamin' in the golden light of day<br />
I ain't holding nothin' back now, I ain't standin' in anybody's way<br />
<br />
Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind<br />
Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind<br />
Well, I paid and I paid and my sufferin' heart is always on the line<br />
<br />
Well, I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade<br />
I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade<br />
I ain't nobody's house boy, I ain't nobody's well trained maid<br />
<br />
I'm flat out spent, this woman been drivin' me to tears<br />
<br>
I'm flat out spent, this woman been drivin' me to tears<br />
This woman so crazy, I swear I ain't gonna touch on another one for years<br />
<br />
Well, the warm weather is comin' and the buds are on the vine<br />
The warm weather is comin' and the buds are on the vine<br />
Ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine<br />
<br />
I got up this mornin', saw the rising sun return<br />
Well, I got up this mornin', saw the rising sun return<br />
Sooner or later, you too shall burn<br />
<br />
The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom<br />
The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom<br />
I've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumblin' tombs<br />
<br />
Let's forgive each other darlin', let's go down to the greenwood glen<br />
Let's forgive each other darlin', let's go down to the greenwood glen<br />
Let's put our heads together, let's put old matters to an end<br />
<br />
Now I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long<br />
Ah, I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long<br />
I woke up this morning, I think I must be traveling wrong</p>
