Spirit on the water <br />
Darkness on the face of the deep <br />
I keep thinking about you baby <br />
I can hardly sleep <br />
<br />
I'm traveling by land <br />
Traveling through the dawn of day <br />
You're always on my mind <br />
I can't stay away<br />
<br />
I had forgotten about you <br />
Then you turned up again <br />
I always knew <br />
We were meant to be more than friends <br />
<br />
When you're near <br />
It's just as plain as it can be <br />
I'm wild about you, girl<br />
You ought to be a fool about me <br />
<br />
Can't explain <br />
The sources of this hidden pain <br />
You burned your way into my heart <br />
You got the key to my brain <br />
<br />
I've been trampling through mud <br />
Praying to the powers above <br />
I'm sweating blood <br />
You got a face that begs for love <br />
<br />
Life without you <br />
Doesn't mean a thing to me <br />
If I can't have you <br />
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea <br />
<br />
Sometimes I wonder <br />
Why you can't treat me right <br />
You do good all day <br />
And then you do wrong all night <br />
<br />
When you're with me <br />
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say <br />
What does it matter <br />
What price I pay?<br />
<br />
They brag about your sugar <br />
Brag about it all over town <br />
Put some sugar in my bowl <br />
I feel like laying down <br />
<br />
<br>
I'm as pale as a ghost <br />
Holding a blossom on a stem <br />
You ever seen a ghost? <br />
No, but you have heard of them <br />
<br />
I see you there <br />
I'm blinded by the colors I see <br />
I'll take good care <br />
Of what belongs to me <br />
<br />
I hear your name <br />
Ringing up and down the line <br />
I'm saying it plain <br />
These ties are strong enough to bind <br />
<br />
Now your sweet voice <br />
Calls out from some old familiar shrine <br />
I've got no choice <br />
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind <br />
<br />
I could live forever <br />
With you perfectly <br />
You don't ever <br />
Have to make a fuss over me <br />
<br />
>
From East to West <br />
Ever since the world began <br />
I only mean it for the best <br />
I want to be with you in any way that I can <br />
<br />
I've been in a brawl <br />
Now I'm feeling the wall <br />
I'm going away baby <br />
I won't be back until fall <br />
<br />
High on the hill <br />
You can carry all my thoughts with you <br />
You've numbed my will <br />
This love could tear me in two <br />
<br />
I want be with you in paradise <br />
And it seems so unfair <br />
I can't go to paradise no more <br />
I killed a man back there <br />
<br />
You think I'm over the hill <br />
You think I'm past my prime <br />
Let me see what you got <br />
We can have a whopping good time<br />
<br />
