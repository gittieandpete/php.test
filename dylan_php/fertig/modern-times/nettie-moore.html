Lost John's sitting on a railroad track <br />
Some thing's out of whack <br />
Blues this morning falling down like hail <br />
Gonna leave a greasy trail <br />
<br />
Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do <br />
Then come back and see you. <br />
All I ever do is struggle and strive. <br />
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive. <br />
<br />
I'm the oldest son of a crazy man, <br />
I'm in a cowboy band <br />
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide <br />
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side <br />
<br />
Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore <br />
And my happiness is over <br />
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise <br />
I loved you then, and ever shall <br />
But there's no one left here to tell <br />
The world has gone black before my eyes <br />
<br />
Well, the world of research has gone berserk <br />
Too much paperwork <br />
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell <br />
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell <br />
<br />
I've gone where the Southern crosses The Yellow Dog <br />
Get away from all these demagogues <br />
And these bad luck women stick like glue <br />
It's either one or the other or neither of the two <br />
<br />
She says, "Look out, Daddy, don't want you to tear your pants. <br />
You could get wrecked in this dance." <br />
They say whisky will kill you, but I don't think it will <br />
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill <br />
<br />
Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore <br />
And my happiness is over <br />
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise <br />
I loved you then, and ever shall <br />
But there's no one left here to tell <br />
<br>
The world has gone black before my eyes <br />
<br />
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before <br />
Don't have to wonder no more <br />
She's been cooking all day, it going to take me all night <br />
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite <br />
<br />
The judge's coming in, everybody rise <br />
Lift up your eyes <br />
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice <br />
Before you call me any dirty names, you better think twice <br />
<br />
Getting light outside, the temperature dropped <br />
I think the rain has stopped <br />
I'm going make you come to grips with fate <br />
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight <br />
<br />
Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore <br />
And my happiness is over <br />
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise <br />
I loved you then, and ever shall <br />
But there's no one left here to tell <br />
The world has gone black before my eyes <br />
<br />
The bright spark of the steady lights <br />
Has dimmed my sights <br />
When you're around me all my grief gives away <br />
A life time with you is like some heavenly day <br />
<br />
Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong <br />
I'll be drifting along <br />
The woman I'm loving she rules my heart <br />
No knife could ever cut our love apart. <br />
<br />
Today I'll stand in faith and raise <br />
The voice of praise <br />
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light <br />
I wish to God that it were night <br />
<br />
The world has gone black before my eyes.<br />
<br />
