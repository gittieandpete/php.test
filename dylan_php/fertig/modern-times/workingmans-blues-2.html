There's an evening haze settling over town <br />
Starlight by the edge of the creek <br />
The buying power of the proletariat's gone down <br />
Money's getting shallow and weak <br />
Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory <br />
It's a new path that we trod <br />
They say low wages are a reality <br />
If we want to compete abroad <br />
<br />
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf <br />
Come sit down on my knee <br />
You are dearer to me than myself <br />
As you yourself can see <br />
While I'm listening to the steel rails hum <br />
Got both eyes tight shut <br />
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from <br />
Creeping it's way into my gut <br />
<br />
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind <br />
Bring me my boots and shoes <br />
You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline <br />
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues <br />
<br />
Well, I'm sailing on back, ready for the long haul <br />
Tossed by the winds and the seas <br />
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall <br />
I'll sell them to their enemies <br />
I'm trying to feed my soul with thought <br />
Going to sleep off the rest of the day <br />
Sometimes no one wants what we got <br />
Sometimes you can't give it away <br />
<br />
Now the place is ringed with countless foes <br />
Some of them may be deaf and dumb <br />
No man, no woman knows <br />
The hour that sorrow will come <br />
In the dark I hear the night birds call <br />
I can feel a lover's breath <br />
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall <br />
<br>
Sleep is like a temporary death <br />
<br />
Well, they burned my barn, and they stole my horse <br />
I can't save a dime <br />
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced <br />
Into a life of continual crime <br />
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking <br />
How I wish you were here to see <br />
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking <br />
That you have forgotten me? <br />
<br />
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret <br />
They waste your nights and days <br />
Them I will forget <br />
But you I'll remember always <br />
Old memories of you to me have clung <br />
You've wounded me with your words <br />
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue <br />
It's all true, everything you've heard <br />
<br />
In you, my friend, I find no blame <br />
Wanna look in my eyes, please do <br />
No one can ever claim <br />
That I took up arms against you <br />
All across the peaceful sacred fields <br />
They will lay you low <br />
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel <br />
I say it so it must be so <br />
<br />
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue <br />
Gonna give you another chance <br />
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you <br />
To lead me off in a cheerful dance <br />
I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife <br />
I can live on rice and beans <br />
Some people never worked a day in their life <br />
Don't know what work even means.<br />
<br />
