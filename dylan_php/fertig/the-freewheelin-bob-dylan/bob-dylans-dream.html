While riding on a train goin' west<br />
I feel asleep for take my a rest<br />
I dreamed a dream that make me sad<br />
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.<br />
<br />
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room<br />
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon<br />
Where we together weathered many a storm<br />
Laughin' and singing 'till the early hours of the morn'.<br />
<br />
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung<br />
Our words were told, our songs were songs<br />
Where we longed for nothin' and were satisfied<br />
Joking and talking about the world outside.<br />
<br />
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold<br />
We never thought we could ever get very old<br />
<br>
We thought we could sit forever in fun<br />
Our chances really was a million to one.<br />
<br />
As easy it was to tell black from white<br />
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right<br />
And our choices they were few and the thought never hit<br />
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.<br />
<br />
How many a year has passed and gone<br />
Many a gamble has been lost and won<br />
And many a road taken by many a first friend<br />
And each one I've never seen again.<br />
<br />
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain<br />
That we could sit simply in that room again<br />
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat<br />
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.</p>
