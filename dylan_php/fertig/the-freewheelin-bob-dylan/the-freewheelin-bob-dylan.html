Some time ago a crazy dream came to me,<br />
I dreamt i was walkin' into world war three,<br />
I went to the doctor the very next day<br />
To see what kinda words he could say.<br />
He said it was a bad dream.<br />
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though,<br />
They were my own dreams and they're only in my head.<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;hold it, doc, a world war passed through my brain.&quot;<br />
He said, &quot;nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane,&quot;<br />
He grabbed my arm, i said &quot;ouch!&quot;<br />
As i landed on the psychiatric couch,<br />
He said, &quot;tell me about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast,<br />
It was all over by quarter past.<br />
I was down in the sewer with some little lover<br />
When i peeked out from a manhole cover<br />
Wondering who turned the lights on.<br />
<br />
Well, i got up and walked around<br />
And up and down the lonesome town.<br />
I stood a-wondering which way to go,<br />
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter<br />
And walked on down the road.<br />
It was a normal day.<br />
<br />
Well, i rung the fallout shelter bell<br />
And i leaned my head and i gave a yell,<br />
&quot;give me a string bean, i'm a hungry man.&quot;<br />
A shotgun fired and away i ran.<br />
I don't blame them too much though,<br />
I know i look funny.<br />
<br />
Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand<br />
I seen a man, i said, &quot;howdy friend,<br />
I guess there's just us two.&quot;<br />
He screamed a bit and away he flew.<br />
Thought i was a communist.<br />
<br />
Well, i spied a girl and before she could leave,<br />
&quot;let's go and play adam and eve.&quot;<br />
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'<br />
<br>
When she said, &quot;hey man, you crazy or sumpin',<br />
You see what happened last time they started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, i seen a cadillac window uptown<br />
And there was nobody aroun',<br />
I got into the driver's seat<br />
And i drove 42nd street<br />
In my cadillac.<br />
Good car to drive after a war.<br />
<br />
Well, i remember seein' some ad,<br />
So i turned on my conelrad.<br />
But i didn't pay my con ed bill,<br />
So the radio didn't work so well.<br />
Turned on my player-<br />
It was rock-a-day, johnny singin',<br />
&quot;tell your ma, tell your pa,<br />
Our loves are gonna grow ooh-wah, ooh-wah.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue,<br />
I needed somebody to talk to.<br />
So i called up the operator of time<br />
Just to hear a voice of some kind.<br />
&quot;when you hear the beep<br />
It will be three o'clock,&quot;<br />
She said that for over an hour<br />
And i hung it up.<br />
<br />
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,<br />
Sayin, &quot;hey i've been havin' the same old dreams,<br />
But mine was a little different you see.<br />
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me.<br />
I didn't see you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, now time passed and now it seems<br />
Everybody's having them dreams.<br />
Everybody sees themselves walkin' around with no one else.<br />
Half of the people can be part right all of the time,<br />
Some of the people can be all right part of the time.<br />
I think abraham lincoln said that.<br />
&quot;i'll let you be in my dreams if i can be in yours,&quot;<br />
I said that.<br />
