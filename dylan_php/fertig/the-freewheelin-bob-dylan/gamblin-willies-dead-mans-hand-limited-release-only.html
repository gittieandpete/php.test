Come around you rovin' gamblers and a story I will tell<br />
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well<br />
His name was Will O'Conley and he gambled all his life<br />
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife<br />
And it's ride, Willie, ride<br />
Roll, Willie, roll<br />
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows<br />
<br />
He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards<br />
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards<br />
He had the reputation as the gamblin'est man around<br />
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town<br />
And it's ride, Willie, ride<br />
Roll, Willie, roll<br />
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows<br />
<br />
Sailin' down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans<br />
They're still talkin' about their card game on that Jackson River Queen<br />
“I've come to win some money,” Gamblin' Willie says<br />
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his<br />
And it's ride, Willie, ride<br />
Roll, Willie, roll<br />
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows<br />
<br />
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek<br />
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week<br />
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down<br />
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town<br />
And it's ride, Willie, ride<br />
Roll, Willie, roll<br />
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows<br />
<br>
<br />
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true<br />
He supported all his children and all their mothers too<br />
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore<br />
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor<br />
And it's ride, Willie, ride<br />
Roll, Willie, roll<br />
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows<br />
<br />
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew<br />
Whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true<br />
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair<br />
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair<br />
And it's ride, Willie, ride<br />
Roll, Willie, roll<br />
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows<br />
<br />
It was late one evenin' during a poker game<br />
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame<br />
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate<br />
When Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights<br />
And it's ride, Willie, ride<br />
Roll, Willie, roll<br />
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows<br />
<br />
So all you rovin' gamblers, wherever you might be<br />
The moral of the story is very plain to see<br />
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop<br />
For when you pull that dead man's hand, your gamblin' days are up<br />
And it's ride, Willie, ride<br />
Roll, Willie, roll<br />
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows</p>
