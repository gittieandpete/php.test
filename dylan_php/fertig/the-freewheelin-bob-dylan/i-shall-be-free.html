Well, I took me a woman late last night<br />
I's three-fourths drunk she looked all right<br />
'Til she started peelin' off her onion gook<br />
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look" ?<br />
I's high flyin', bare naked ...Out the window.<br />
<br />
Well, sometimes I might get drunk<br />
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk<br />
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride<br />
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side<br />
(She's a tryin' a hide pretendin'<br />
She don't know me).<br />
<br />
I's out there paintin' on the old wood shed<br />
When a can a black paint it fell on my head<br />
I went down to scrub and rub<br />
But I had to sit in back of the tub<br />
(Cost a quarter<br />
Half price).<br />
<br />
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop <br />
It's President Kennedy callin' me up<br />
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow" ?<br />
I said, "My friend, John, "Brigitte Bardot,<br />
Anita Ekberg<br />
Sophia Loren"<br />
Country'll grow.<br />
<br />
Well, I got a woman five feet short<br />
She yells and hollers and squeals and snorts<br />
She tickles my nose pats me on the head<br />
Blows me over and kicks me out of bed<br />
(She's a man eater <br />
Meat grinder<br />
Bad looser).<br />
<br />
Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' alla time<br />
I got a woman who works herself blind<br />
Works up to her britches, up to her neck<br />
Write me letters and sends me checks<br />
(She's a humdinger<br />
<br>
Folk singer).<br />
<br />
Late one day in the middle of the week<br />
Eyes were closed I was half asleep <br />
I chased me a woman up the hill<br />
Right in the middle of an air drill<br />
(I jumped a fallout shelter<br />
I jumped the string bean<br />
I jumped the TV dinner<br />
I jumped the shot gun).<br />
<br />
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote<br />
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note<br />
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple<br />
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people<br />
(He's eatin' bagels<br />
He's eatin' pizza<br />
He's eatin' chitlins).<br />
<br />
Oh, set me down on a television floor<br />
I'll flip the channel to number four<br />
Out of the shower comes a football man<br />
With a bottle of oil in his hand<br />
(Greasy kid stuff<br />
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is<br />
What do you do about Willy Mays<br />
Martin Luther King<br />
Olatunji).<br />
<br />
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen<br />
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean<br />
She takes about fifteen baths a day<br />
Wants me to grow a moustache on my face<br />
(She's insane).<br />
<br />
Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time<br />
It levels my head and eases my mind<br />
I just walk along and stroll and sing<br />
I see better days and I do better things<br />
(I catch dinosaurs<br />
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor ...<br />
Catch hell from Richard Burton !).</p>
