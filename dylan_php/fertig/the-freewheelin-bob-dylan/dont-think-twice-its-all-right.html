Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe<br />
Even you don't know by now<br />
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe<br />
It'll never do somehow<br />
<br />
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn<br />
Look out your window, and I'll be gone<br />
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on<br />
But don't think twice, it's all right.<br />
<br />
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe<br />
The light I never knowed<br />
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe<br />
I'm on the dark side of the road<br />
<br />
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say<br />
To try and make me change my mind and stay<br />
But we never did too much talking anyway<br />
But don't think twice, it's all right.<br />
<br>
<br />
So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal<br />
Like you never done before<br />
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal<br />
I can't hear you any more<br />
<br />
I'm a-thinking and a-wonderin' walking down the road<br />
I once loved a woman, a child I am told<br />
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul<br />
But don't think twice, it's all right.<br />
<br />
So long honey, baby<br />
Where I'm bound, I can't tell<br />
Goodbye's too good a word, babe<br />
So I'll just say fare thee well<br />
<br />
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind<br />
You could have done better but I don't mind<br />
You just kinda wasted my precious time<br />
But don't think twice, it's all right.</p>
