Oxford Town, Oxford Town<br />
Ev'rybody's got their hats bowed down<br />
The sun don't shine above the ground<br />
Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town.<br />
<br />
He went down to Oxford Town<br />
Guns and clubs followed him down<br />
All because his face was brown<br />
Better get away from Oxford Town.<br />
<br />
Oxford Town around the bend<br />
He comes to the door, he couln't get in<br />
<br>
All because of the color of his skin<br />
What do you think about that, my frien' ?<br />
<br />
Me and my gal, my gal's son<br />
We got met with a tear gas bomb<br />
I don't even know why we come<br />
Goin' back where we come from.<br />
<br />
Oxford Town in the afternoon<br />
Ev'rybody singin' a sorrowful tune<br />
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon<br />
Somebody better investigate soon.</p>
