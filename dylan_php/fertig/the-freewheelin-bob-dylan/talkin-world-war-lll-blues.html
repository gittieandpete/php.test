Some time ago a crazy dream came to me<br />
I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three<br />
I went to the doctor the very next day<br />
To see what kinda words he could say<br />
He said it was a bad dream<br />
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though<br />
They're dreams and they're only in your head.<br />
<br />
I said, "Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain".<br />
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane".<br />
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch".<br />
As I landed on the psychiatric couch<br />
He said, "Tell me about it".<br />
<br />
Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast<br />
It was all over by quarter past<br />
I was down in the sewer with some little lover<br />
When I peeked out from a manhole cover<br />
Wondering who turned the lights on.<br />
<br />
Well, I got up and walked around<br />
And up and down the lonesome town<br />
I stood a-wondering which way to go<br />
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter<br />
And walked on down the road<br />
It was a normal day.<br />
<br />
Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell<br />
And leaned my head and I gave a yell<br />
"Give me a string bean I'm a hungry man"<br />
A shortgun fired and away I ran<br />
I don't blame them too much though<br />
They didn't know me.<br />
<br />
Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand<br />
I seen a man I said "Howdy friend,<br />
I guess there's just us two"<br />
He screamed a bit and away he flew<br />
Thought it was a Communist.<br />
<br />
Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave<br />
"Let's go and play Adam and Eve"<br />
<br>
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'<br />
When she said, "Hey man, you crazy or sumpin'<br />
You see what happened last time they started".<br />
Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown<br />
And there was nobody aroun'<br />
I got into the driver's seat<br />
 And I drove down to 42nd Street<br />
In my Cadillac<br />
Good car to drive after a war.<br />
<br />
Well, I remember seein' some ad<br />
So I turned on my Conelrad<br />
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill<br />
So the radio didn't work so well<br />
Turned on my record player<br />
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singin'<br />
"Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa<br />
Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah"<br />
.<br />
I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue<br />
I needed somebody to talk to<br />
So I called up the operator of time<br />
Just to hear a voice of some kind<br />
"When you hear the beep<br />
It will be three o'clock"<br />
She said that for over an hour<br />
And I hung up.<br />
<br />
Well the doctor interrupted me just about then<br />
Sayin' "Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams<br />
But mine was a little different you see<br />
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me<br />
I didn't see you around".<br />
<br />
Well, now time passed and now it seems<br />
Everybody's having them dreams<br />
Everybody sees themselves walkin' around with no one else<br />
Half of the people can be part right all of the time<br />
Some of the people can be all right part of the time<br />
But all of the people can't be all right all of the time<br />
I think Abraham Lincoln said that<br />
"I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours"<br />
I said that.</p>
