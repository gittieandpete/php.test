Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto<br />
They are ridin' down the line<br />
Fixin' ev'rybody's troubles<br />
Ev'rybody's 'cept mine<br />
Somebody musta tol' 'em<br />
That I was doin' fine.<br />
<br />
Oh you five and ten cent women<br />
With nothin' in your heads<br />
I got a real gal I'm lovin'<br />
And Lord I'll be love her till I'm dead<br />
Go away from my door and window too<br />
Right now.<br />
<br />
Lord, I ain't goin' down to no race track<br />
See no sports car run<br />
<br>
I don't have no sports car<br />
And I don't even care to have one<br />
I can walk anytime around the block.<br />
<br />
Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me<br />
Up and down the street<br />
With my hat in my hand<br />
And my boots on my feet<br />
Watch out so you don't step on me.<br />
<br />
Well, look it here buddy<br />
You want to be like me<br />
Pull out your six-shooter<br />
And rob every bank you can see<br />
Tell the judge I said it was all right<br />
Yes.</p>
