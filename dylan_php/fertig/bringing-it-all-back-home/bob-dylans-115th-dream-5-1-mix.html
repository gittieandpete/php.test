I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land<br />
I yelled for Captain Arab I have you understand<br />
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale<br />
We're going over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail<br />
Haul on the bowline," we sang that melody<br />
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea<br />
<br />
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land<br />
I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand<br />
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds<br />
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads"<br />
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon<br />
He throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons<br />
<br />
Ah, me, I busted out, don't even ask me how<br />
I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow<br />
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums<br />
Where people carried signs around, saying, "Ban the bums"<br />
I jumped right into line saying, "I hope that I'm not late"<br />
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight<br />
<br />
I went into a restaurant, lookin' for the cook<br />
I told them I was the editor of a famous etiquette book<br />
The waitress he was handsome, he wore a powder blue cape<br />
I ordered some suzette, I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"<br />
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin' fat<br />
Food was flying everywhere, I left without my hat<br />
<br />
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank<br />
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank<br />
They asked me for some collateral, and I pulled down my pants<br />
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France<br />
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend<br />
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again<br />
<br />
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display<br />
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way"<br />
The man says, "Get out of here, I'll tear you limb from limb"<br />
<br>
I said, "You know they refused Jesus, too." He said, "You're not Him<br />
Get out of here before I break your bones, I ain't your pop"<br />
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop<br />
<br />
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab<br />
I went out the other door, this Englishman said, "Fab"<br />
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood<br />
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood<br />
I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does<br />
But it was just a funeral parlor, and the man asked me who I was<br />
<br />
I repeated that my friends were all in jail, with a sigh<br />
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die"<br />
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street<br />
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet<br />
A pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind<br />
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line<br />
<br />
Well, by this time I was fed up at tryin' to make a stab<br />
At bringin' back any help for my friends and Captain Arab<br />
I decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails<br />
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail<br />
So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip<br />
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship<br />
<br />
Well, I got back and took the parkin' ticket off the mast<br />
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past<br />
They asked me my name and I said, "Captain Kidd"<br />
They believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that I did<br />
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed<br />
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid<br />
<br />
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale<br />
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail<br />
But the funniest thing was when I was leavin' the bay<br />
I saw three ships a-sailin', they were all heading my way<br />
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck<br />
He said his name was Columbus. I just said, "Good luck"</p>
