Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides<br />
Upon four-legged forest clouds, the cowboy angel rides<br />
With his candle lit into the sun, though its glow is waxed in black<br />
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden<br />
<br />
The lamppost stands with folded arms, its iron claws attached<br />
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail, though it shadows metal badge<br />
All and all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow<br />
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden<br />
<br />
The savage soldier just sticks his head in sand and then complains<br />
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf, but still remains<br />
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails<br />
Heading for the gates of Eden<br />
<br />
With a time-rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp<br />
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, sidesaddle on the Golden Calf<br />
And on their promises of paradise, you will not hear a laugh<br />
All except inside the gates of Eden<br />
<br />
Relationships of ownership, they whisper in the wings<br />
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings<br />
<br>
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings<br />
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden<br />
<br />
The motorcycle black Madonna, two-wheeled gypsy queen<br />
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream<br />
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey who pick upon his bread crumb sins<br />
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden<br />
<br />
The kingdoms of experience, in the precious winds they rot<br />
While paupers change possessions, each one wishing for what the other has got<br />
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what is not<br />
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden<br />
<br />
The foreign sun, it squints upon a bed that is never mine<br />
As friends and other strangers from their fates try to resign<br />
Leaving men wholly, totally free to do anything they wish to do but die<br />
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden<br />
<br />
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams<br />
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse into the ditch of what each one means<br />
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true<br />
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden</p>
