Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?<br />
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?<br />
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon<br />
<br />
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture frame<br />
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture frame<br />
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like a Jesse James<br />
<br />
An' I wish I was on some Australian mountain range<br />
<br>
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range<br />
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kind of change<br />
<br />
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth<br />
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carryin' my good luck marked black tooth<br />
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin', I just might tell you the truth<br />
<br />
I got a woman in Jackson, oh, I ain't gonna say her name<br />
I got a woman in Jackson, I ain't gonna say her name<br />
She's a brown-skinned woman but I love her just the same</p>
