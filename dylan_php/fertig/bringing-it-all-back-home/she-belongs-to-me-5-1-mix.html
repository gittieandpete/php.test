She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back<br />
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back<br />
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black<br />
<br />
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees<br />
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees<br />
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole, down upon your knees<br />
<br />
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall<br />
<br>
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall<br />
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all<br />
<br />
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks<br />
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks<br />
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique<br />
<br />
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes<br />
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes<br />
For Halloween, buy her a trumpet and for Christmas, give her a drum</p>
