Dear, I thought I'd drop a line<br />
The weather's cool. The folks are fine<br />
I'm in bed each night at nine<br />
P.S. I love you<br />
<br />
Yesterday we had some rain<br />
But all in all I can't complain<br />
Was it dusty on the train?<br />
P.S. I love you<br />
<br />
Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able<br />
They came around to call<br />
I burned a hole in the dining room table<br />
And let me see, I guess that's all<br />
<br />
<br>
Nothin' else for me to say<br />
And so I'll close. Oh, by the way<br />
Everybody's thinkin' of you<br />
P.S. I love you<br />
<br />
I do my best to obey all your wishes<br />
I put a sign up. Think<br />
Now I got to buy us a new set of dishes<br />
Or wash the ones that have piled in the sink<br />
<br />
Nothing else to tell you, dear<br />
Except, each day feels like a year<br />
Every night I'm dreamin' of you<br />
P.S. I love you<br />
P.S. I love you</p>
