It isn't by chance I happen to be<br />
A boulevardier, the toast of Paris<br />
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke<br />
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke<br />
I walk in a room, a party or ball<br />
"Come sit over here" somebody will call<br />
"A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all!"<br />
But how many times I stop and recall<br />
<br />
Ah, the apple trees<br />
Blossoms in the breeze<br />
That we walked among<br />
Lying in the hay<br />
Games we used to play<br />
While the rounds were sung<br />
Only yesterday, when the world was young<br />
<br />
Wherever I go they mention my name<br />
And that in itself, is some sort of fame<br />
"Come by for a drink, we're having a game"<br />
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came<br />
The talk is quite gay, the company fine<br />
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine<br />
And beautiful girls and some of them mine<br />
But often my eyes see a different shine<br />
<br>
<br />
Ah, the apple trees<br />
Sunlit memories<br />
Where the hammock swung<br />
On our backs we'd lie<br />
Looking at the sky<br />
Till the stars were strung<br />
Only last July when the world was young<br />
<br />
Ah, the apple trees<br />
Blossoms in the breeze<br />
That we walked among<br />
Lying in the hay<br />
Games we used to play<br />
While the rounds were sung<br />
Only yesterday, when the world was young<br />
<br />
While sitting around, we often recall<br />
The laugh of the year, the night of them all<br />
The blonde who was so attractive that year<br />
Some opening night that made us all cheer<br />
Remember that time we all got so tight<br />
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight<br />
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light<br />
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright</p>
