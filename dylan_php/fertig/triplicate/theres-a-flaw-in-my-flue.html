I used to sit by my fireplace<br />
And dream about you<br />
But now that won't do<br />
There's a flaw in my flue<br />
<br />
Your lovely face in my fireplace<br />
Was all that I saw<br />
But now it won't draw<br />
<br>
My flue has a flaw<br />
<br />
From every beautiful ember a memory arose<br />
Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose<br />
It's not as sweet as the unit-heat<br />
To dream about you<br />
So darling, adieu<br />
There's a flaw in my flue</p>
