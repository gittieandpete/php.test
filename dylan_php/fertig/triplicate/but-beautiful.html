Love is funny or it's sad<br />
Or it's quiet or it's mad<br />
It's a good thing or it's bad<br />
But beautiful<br />
<br />
Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall<br />
 And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all<br />
<br />
Love is tearful or it's gay<br />
It's a problem or it's play<br />
It's a heartache either way<br />
<br>
But beautiful<br />
<br />
And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go<br />
And that would be but beautiful, I know<br />
<br />
Love is tearful or it's gay<br />
It's a problem or it's play<br />
It's a heartache either way<br />
But it's beautiful<br />
<br />
And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go<br />
And that would be but beautiful, I know</p>
