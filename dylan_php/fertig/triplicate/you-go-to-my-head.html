You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain <br />
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain <br />
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne <br />
<br />
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew <br />
And I find the very mention of you <br />
Like the kicker in a julep or two <br />
<br />
The thrill of the thought <br />
That you might give a thought to my plea cast a spell over me <br />
<br>
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself <br />
Can't you see that it never can be <br />
<br />
You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise <br />
Like the summer with a thousand July's <br />
You intoxicate my very soul with your eyes <br />
<br />
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine <br />
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance <br />
You go to my head <br />
You go to my head</p>
