Day in, day out<br />
The same old voodoo follows me about<br />
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you<br />
And darling, I think of you, day in and day out<br />
<br />
Day out, day in<br />
I needn't tell you how my days begin<br />
When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view<br />
That possibility of maybe seeing you<br />
<br />
Come rain, come shine<br />
I meet you and to me the day is fine<br />
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes<br />
The oceans roar, a thousand drums<br />
<br />
Can't you see it's love<br />
Can there be any doubt<br />
When there it is<br />
<br>
Day in, day out<br />
<br />
Come rain, come shine<br />
I meet you and to me the day is fine<br />
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes<br />
The oceans roar, a thousand drums<br />
<br />
Can't you see it's love<br />
Can there be any doubt<br />
When there it is<br />
Day in, day out<br />
<br />
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes<br />
The oceans roar, a thousand drums<br />
<br />
Can't you see it's love<br />
Can there be any doubt<br />
When there it is<br />
Day in, day out</p>
