One day you turn around and it's summer<br />
Next day you turn around and it's fall<br />
And the springs and the winters of a lifetime<br />
Whatever happened to them all?<br />
<br />
As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways<br />
Now I'm reaching back for yesterdays<br />
'Til a long-forgotten love appears<br />
And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near<br />
<br>
September, the warm September of my years<br />
<br />
As I man who has never paused at wishing wells<br />
Now I'm watching children's carousels<br />
And their laughter's music to my ears<br />
And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near<br />
September, the warm September of my years<br />
<br />
The golden warm September of my years</p>
