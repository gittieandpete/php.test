Why was I born tell me why I am living<br />
What do I give or what am I'm giving<br />
What do I want anything I can not hope for<br />
What can I hope for I wish I knew<br />
<br />
Why do I try to draw you near me<br />
Honey tell me why do I cry<br />
Cause you're never gonna hear me<br />
I'm a poor fool<br />
<br>
But what can I do, I do<br />
Why was I born to love you<br />
<br />
Why do I try to draw you near me<br />
Honey tell me why do I cry<br />
Cause you're never gonna hear me<br />
I'm a poor fool<br />
But what can I do, I do<br />
Why was I born to love you</p>
