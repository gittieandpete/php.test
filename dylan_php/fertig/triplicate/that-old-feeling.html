I saw you last night and got that old feeling<br />
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling<br />
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill<br />
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still<br />
<br />
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning<br />
<br>
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning<br />
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start<br />
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart<br />
<br />
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start<br />
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart</p>
