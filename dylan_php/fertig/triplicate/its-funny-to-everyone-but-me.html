It's funny how you loved me<br />
Then forgot so suddenly<br />
It's funny to everyone but me<br />
(It's the talk of the town)<br />
<br />
They told me this would happen<br />
Now they're laughing secretly<br />
It's funny to everyone but me<br />
(Gosh, he's crying again)<br />
<br />
I should shrug my shoulders and say<br />
<br>
Good riddance to a bad affair<br />
But how can I do, but my head tells me to<br />
When my heart tells me how much I care<br />
<br />
It's so funny, I still love you<br />
It's the joke of the century<br />
It's funny to everyone but me<br />
(I have the right to think of you)<br />
<br />
It's so funny, I still love you<br />
It's the joke of the century<br />
Ah, but it's funny to everyone but me</p>
