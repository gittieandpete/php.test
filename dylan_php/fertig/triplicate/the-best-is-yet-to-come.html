Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum<br />
You came along and everything started to hum<br />
Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come<br />
<br />
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?<br />
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine<br />
<br />
Wait till the warm-up's underway<br />
Wait till our lips have met<br />
Wait till you see that sunshine day<br />
You ain't seen nothin' yet!<br />
<br />
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?<br />
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine<br />
<br />
Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly<br />
<br>
We're gonna taste of the wine<br />
We're gonna drain the cup dry<br />
<br />
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround<br />
You think you've flown before but you ain't left the ground<br />
<br />
Wait till you're locked in my embrace<br />
Wait till I draw you near<br />
Wait till you see that sunshine place<br />
Ain't nothin' like it here!<br />
<br />
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine<br />
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine<br />
<br />
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum<br />
You came along and everything started to hum</p>
