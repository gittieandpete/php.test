Braggin'<br />
Wastin' all your time just braggin'<br />
When ya' should be busy<br />
Plowin' and a'plantin'<br />
You stand there a'rantin'<br />
Get no harvest [?] your heart<br />
<br />
Braggin'<br />
You ain't got no cause for braggin'<br />
When your barn needs mendin'<br />
And your lawn needs mowin'<br />
How come you're a crowin'<br />
Like a no-good rooster at dawn<br />
<br />
<br>
Braggin' 'bout your fishin'<br />
'Bout your horseshoe pitchin'<br />
Bet you always keep the score<br />
Talkin' 'bout your meddle<br />
That's the kind they peddle<br />
Down at the 5 and 10 store<br />
<br />
Braggin'<br />
Folks ain't got no use for braggin'<br />
If your fields are greener<br />
Folks will hear about it<br />
You don't hafta shout it<br />
Fields were greener 'fore you were born<br />
