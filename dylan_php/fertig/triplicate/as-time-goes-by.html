You must remember this<br />
A kiss is still a kiss<br />
A sigh is still just a sigh<br />
The fundamental things apply<br />
As time goes by<br />
<br />
And when two lovers woo<br />
They still say "I love you"<br />
On that you can rely<br />
No matter what the future brings<br />
As time goes by<br />
<br>
<br />
Moonlight and love songs never out of date<br />
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate<br />
Woman needs man and man must have his mate<br />
That no one can deny<br />
<br />
It's still the same old story<br />
A fight for love and glory<br />
A case of do or die<br />
The world will always welcome lovers<br />
As time goes by</p>
