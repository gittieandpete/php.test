I used to walk with you<br />
Along the avenue<br />
Our hearts were carefree and gay<br />
How could I know I'd lose you<br />
Somewhere along the way?<br />
<br />
The friends we used to know<br />
Would always smile "Hello"<br />
No love like our love they'd say<br />
Then love slipped through our fingers<br />
Somewhere along the way<br />
<br />
I should forget<br />
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything<br />
You're gone and yet<br />
There's still a feeling deep inside<br />
That you will always be part of me<br />
<br />
<br>
So now I look for you<br />
Along the avenue<br />
And as I wander I pray<br />
That some day soon I'll find you<br />
Somewhere along the way<br />
<br />
I should forget<br />
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything<br />
You're gone and yet<br />
There's still a feeling deep inside<br />
That you will always be part of me<br />
<br />
So now I look for you<br />
Along the avenue<br />
And as I wander I pray<br />
That some day soon I'll find you<br />
Somewhere along the way<br />
Somewhere along the way</p>
