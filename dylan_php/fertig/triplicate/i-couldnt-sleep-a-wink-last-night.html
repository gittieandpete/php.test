I couldn't sleep a wink last night<br />
Because we had that silly fight<br />
I thought my heart would break the whole night through<br />
I knew that you'd be sorry<br />
And I'm sorry too<br />
<br />
I didn't have my favorite dream<br />
The one in which I hold you tight<br />
I had to call you up this morning<br />
<br>
To see if everything was still all right<br />
Yes, I had to call you up this morning<br />
'Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night<br />
<br />
I didn't have my favorite dream<br />
The one in which I hold you tight<br />
I had to call you up this morning<br />
To see if everything was still all right<br />
Yes, I had to call you up this morning<br />
Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night</p>
