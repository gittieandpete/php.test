How much do I love you?<br />
I'll tell you no lie<br />
How deep is the ocean?<br />
How high is the sky?<br />
<br />
How many times a day do I think of you?<br />
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?<br />
<br />
How far would I travel<br />
To be where you are?<br />
How far is the journey<br />
From here to a star?<br />
<br />
<br>
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?<br />
How deep is the ocean?<br />
How high is the sky?<br />
<br />
How far would I travel<br />
To be where you are?<br />
How far is the journey<br />
From here to a star?<br />
<br />
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?<br />
How deep is the ocean?<br />
How high is the sky?<br />
How high is the sky?</p>
