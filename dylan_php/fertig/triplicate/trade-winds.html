Here I stand looking, looking around me<br />
While all around me what do I see<br />
Unhappy faces behind a painted smile<br />
Heartache and loneliness dressed up in modern style<br />
Unhappy people living in sin and shame<br />
Reflections of myself, life is no easy game<br />
And we're caught in the trade winds<br />
The trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
Here I stand looking, looking around me<br />
While all around me what do I see<br />
Young girls who'll soon become<br />
Streetwalkers in the night<br />
Young boys, the restless breed<br />
Looking for a fight<br />
Children both rich and poor<br />
They're searching for the truth<br />
And if they don't find it<br />
God help tomorrow's youth<br />
We're caught in the trade winds<br />
The trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
Trade winds are blowing, blowing around me<br />
While all around me what do I see<br />
Hatred and jealousy<br />
Brotherhood is dying<br />
Love is the answer<br />
Nobody's buying<br />
Good people turning bad<br />
Some don't but they are few<br />
The winds are blowing<br />
The choice is all up to you<br />
We're caught in the trade winds<br />
<br>
The trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
Yes we're caught up in the trade winds<br />
The trade winds of our time<br />
And we are riding on the trade winds<br />
The trade wind of our time<br />
<br />
We're caught up<br />
Caught up in the trade winds, the trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
We are riding<br />
Riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
We're caught up<br />
Caught up on the trade winds, the trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
And we're riding<br />
Riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
We are riding, yes we're riding<br />
Trade wings of our time<br />
<br />
We're caught up<br />
Caught up in the trade winds, trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
We are riding<br />
We're riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
And we're caught up<br />
In the trade winds, trade winds of our time<br />
<br />
We are riding<br />
Riding on the trade wings, the trade winds of our time</p>
