Once upon a time<br />
A girl with moonlight in her eyes<br />
Put her hand in mine<br />
And said she loved me so<br />
But that was once upon a time<br />
Very long ago<br />
<br />
Once upon a hill<br />
We sat beneath a willow tree<br />
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn<br />
But that was once upon a time<br />
Now the tree is gone<br />
<br />
<br>
How the breeze ruffled through her hair<br />
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn&rsquo;t there<br />
We were young and didn&rsquo;t have a care<br />
Where did it go<br />
<br />
Once upon a time<br />
The world was sweeter than we knew<br />
Everything was ours<br />
How happy we were then<br />
But somehow once upon a time<br />
Never comes again<br />
<br />
Once upon a time<br />
Never comes again</p>
