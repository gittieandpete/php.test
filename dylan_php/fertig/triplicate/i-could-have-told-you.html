[Verse 1]<br />
I could have told you<br />
She'd hurt you<br />
She'd you love you a while<br />
Then desert you<br />
If only you asked<br />
I could have told you so<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
I could have saved you<br />
Some crying<br />
Yes, I could have told you she's lying<br />
But you were in love<br />
And didn't want to know<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
I hear her now<br />
<br>
As I toss and turn and try to sleep<br />
I hear her now<br />
Making promises she'll never keep<br />
And soon, it's over and done with<br />
She'll find someone new to have fun with<br />
Through all of my tears<br />
I could have told you so<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
I hear her now<br />
As I toss and turn and try to sleep<br />
I hear her now<br />
Making promises she'll never keep<br />
And soon, it's over and done with<br />
She'll find someone new to have fun with<br />
Through all of my tears<br />
I could have told you so</p>
