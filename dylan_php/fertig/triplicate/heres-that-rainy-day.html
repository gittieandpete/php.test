Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams<br />
Funny but here's that rainy day<br />
Here's that rainy day they told me about<br />
And I laughed at the thought<br />
That it might turn out this way<br />
<br />
<br>
Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside<br />
After it brought my love so near<br />
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day<br />
Funny that rainy day is here<br />
<br />
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day<br />
Funny that rainy day is here</p>
