I guess I'll have to change my plan<br />
I should have realized there'd be another man<br />
I overlooked that point completely<br />
Until the big affair began<br />
<br />
Before I knew where I was at<br />
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that<br />
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there<br />
All that I could get was the air<br />
<br />
My feet are back upon the ground<br />
I lost the one girl I'd found<br />
<br>
<br />
Before I knew where I was at<br />
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that<br />
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there<br />
All that I could get was the air<br />
<br />
My feet are back upon the ground<br />
I lost the one girl<br />
The one girl I'd found<br />
<br />
My boiling point is much too low<br />
For me to try to be a fly Lothario</p>
