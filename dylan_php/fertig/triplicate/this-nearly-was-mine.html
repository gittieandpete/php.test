One dream in my heart, one love to be living for<br />
One love to be living for, this nearly was mine<br />
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise<br />
This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine<br />
<br>
<br />
Close to my heart she came, only to fly away<br />
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight<br />
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise<br />
Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine</p>
