When you're all alone<br />
All the children grown<br />
And, like starlings, flown away<br />
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?<br />
Lonely early, doesn't it?<br />
Ev'ry single endless day<br />
<br />
When your twilight nears<br />
And one face appears<br />
<br>
Turning winter years to May<br />
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?<br />
Lonely early, doesn't it?<br />
Still the old heart's young enough to say<br />
<br />
"It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?<br />
"Truly lovely, wasn't it?"<br />
Strings<br />
Ev'ry single lovely day</p>
