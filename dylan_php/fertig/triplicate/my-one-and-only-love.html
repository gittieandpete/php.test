The very thought of you makes my heart sing<br />
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring<br />
And you appear in all your splendor<br />
My one and only love<br />
<br />
The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms<br />
In the hush of night while you're in my arms<br />
I feel your lips so warm and tender<br />
My one and only love<br />
<br />
The touch of your hand is like heaven<br />
A heaven that I've never known<br />
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak<br />
Tells me that you are my own<br />
<br>
<br />
You fill my eager heart with such desire<br />
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire<br />
I give myself in sweet surrender<br />
My one and only love<br />
<br />
The touch of your hand is like heaven<br />
A heaven that I've never known<br />
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak<br />
Tells me that you are my own<br />
<br />
You fill my eager heart with such desire<br />
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire<br />
I give myself in sweet surrender<br />
My one and only love</p>
