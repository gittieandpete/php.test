He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks<br />
Preoccupied with his vengeance<br />
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back<br />
I'm sure that he has no intentions<br />
Of looking your way, unless it's to say<br />
That he needs you to test his inventions.<br />
<br />
Can you please crawl out your window?<br />
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you<br />
How can you say he will haunt you?<br />
You can go back to him any time you want to.<br />
<br />
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels<br />
Trying to peel the moon and expose it<br />
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel<br />
If he needs a third eye he just grows it<br />
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk<br />
Or pick it up after he throws it.<br />
<br>
<br />
Can you please crawl out your window?<br />
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you<br />
How can you say he will haunt you?<br />
You can go back to him any time you want to.<br />
<br />
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed<br />
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in<br />
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange<br />
Their religion of the little ten women<br />
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised<br />
Come on out the dark is beginning.<br />
<br />
Can you please crawl out your window?<br />
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you<br />
How can you say he will haunt you?<br />
You can go back to him any time you want to.<br />
