Rita May, Rita May<br />
You got your body in the way<br />
You're so damn nonchalant<br />
But it's your mind that I want<br />
<br />
You got me huffin' and a-puffin'<br />
Next to you I feel like nothin' Rita May<br />
<br />
Rita May, Rita May<br />
How'd you ever get that way?<br />
When do you ever see the light?<br />
Don't you ever feel a fright?<br />
<br />
You got me burnin' and I'm turnin'<br />
But I know I must be learnin' Rita May<br />
<br />
All my friends have told me<br />
If I hang around with you that I'll go blind<br />
But when you hold me<br />
I know there must be somethin' on your mind<br />
<br>
<br />
Rita May, Rita May<br />
Won't you come out and play?<br />
[Incomprehensible] where you been?<br />
What's that crazy place you're in?<br />
<br />
I'm gonna have to go to college<br />
'Cause you are the book of knowledge Rita May<br />
<br />
All my friends have told me<br />
If I hang around with you that I'll go blind<br />
But I know when you hold me<br />
That there really must be somethin' on your mind<br />
<br />
Rita May, Rita May<br />
You got your body in the way<br />
You're so damn nonchalant<br />
It's your mind that I want<br />
<br />
I'm gonna have to go to college<br />
'Cause you are the book of knowledge Rita May</p>
