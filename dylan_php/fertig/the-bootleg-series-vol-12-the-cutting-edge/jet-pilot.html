Well, she's got jet pilot eyes from her hips on down.<br />
All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town.<br />
She's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench.<br />
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.<br />
<br>
She got all the downtown boys, all at her command<br />
But you've got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman<br />
She's a man.<br />
