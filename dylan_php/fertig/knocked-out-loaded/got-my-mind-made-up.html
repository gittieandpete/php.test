Don't ever try to change me <br />
I been in this thing too long<br />
There's nothing you can say or do <br />
To make me think I'm wrong<br />
Well I'm going off to Libya <br />
There's guy I gotta see<br />
He's been living there three years now <br />
In an oil refinery<br />
I've got my mind made up<br />
I've got my mind made up.<br />
<br />
Call your Ma in Talahassee<br />
Tell her her baby's on the line<br />
Tell her not to worry<br />
Everything is gonna be fine<br />
Well I gave you all my money<br />
All my connections too<br />
<br>
There ain't nothing in this world girl<br />
You can say I didn't give to you<br />
I've got my mind made up<br />
I've got my mind made up.<br />
<br />
You will be alright girl<br />
Someone's watching over you<br />
He won't do nothing to you<br />
Baby that I wouldn't do<br />
Well if you don't want to see me<br />
Look the other way<br />
You don't have to feed me<br />
I ain't your dog that's gone astray<br />
I've got my mind made up<br />
I've got my mind made up.<br />
I've got my mind made up<br />
I've got my mind made up.<br />
I've got my mind made up.</p>
