Something about you that I can't shake <br />
Don't know how much more of this I can take<br />
I'm under your spell.<br />
<br />
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night<br />
When my last dream exploded I noticed your light<br />
Baby, oh what a story I could tell.<br />
<br />
It's been nice seeing you you red me like a book<br />
If you ever want to reach me you know where to look<br />
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.<br />
<br />
I'd like to help you but I'm in a bit of a jam<br />
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am<br />
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.<br />
<br />
But I will be back I will survive<br />
<br>
You'll never get rid of me as long you're alive<br />
Baby, can't you tell.<br />
<br />
Well it's four in the morning by the sounds of the birds<br />
I'm staring at your picture I'm hearing your words<br />
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.<br />
<br />
Turn back baby wipe your eye <br />
Don't think I'm leaving here without a kiss goodbye<br />
Baby, is there anything left to tell ?<br />
<br />
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head<br />
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead<br />
Baby, what more can I tell ?<br />
<br />
Well the desert is hot the mountain is cursed<br />
Pray that I don't die of thirst<br />
Baby, two feet from the well.</p>
