Maybe someday you'll be satisfied<br />
When you've lost everything you'll have nothing left to hide.<br />
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,<br />
Maybe you'll beg me to take you back.<br />
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,<br />
Maybe then you'll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool.<br />
Maybe someday when you're by yourself alone<br />
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,<br />
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned.<br />
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim<br />
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.<br />
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,<br />
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.<br />
Maybe someday, you will understand<br />
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.<br />
<br>
<br />
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt<br />
When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt.<br />
When both of us, baby, were going though some sort of a test<br />
Neither one of us could do what we do best.<br />
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff.<br />
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.<br />
Maybe someday, you'll believe me when I say<br />
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high<br />
Sayin' "For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?"<br />
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do<br />
For not breakin' down no bedroom door to get at you.<br />
Always was a sucker for the right cross.<br />
Never wanted to go home 'til the last cent was lost.<br />
Maybe someday you will look back and see<br />
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.</p>
