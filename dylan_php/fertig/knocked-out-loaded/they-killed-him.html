There was a man named Hatma Gandi<br />
He would not bow down he would not fight<br />
He knew the deal was down and dirty<br />
And nothing wrong could make it right away<br />
But he knew his duty and the prize he had to pay<br />
Just another holy man who tried to be a friend<br />
My God, they killed him.<br />
<br />
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia<br />
By name of Martin Luther King<br />
He shook the land like the rolling thunder<br />
And made the bells of freedom ring today<br />
With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away<br />
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand<br />
My God, they killed him.<br />
<br />
The only Son of God Almighty<br />
The holy one called Jesus Christ<br />
He healed the lame and fed the hungry<br />
<br>
And for his love they took his life away<br />
On the road to glory where the story never ends<br />
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand<br />
My God, they killed him.<br />
<br />
There was a man named Mahatma Gandi<br />
A man named Martin Luther King<br />
The only Son of God Almighty<br />
The only one called Jesus Christ<br />
On the road to glory where the story never ends<br />
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand<br />
My God, they killed him.<br />
