I didn't know that you'd be leaving<br />
Or who you thought you were talking to<br />
I figure maybe we're even<br />
Or maybe I'm one up on you<br />
I send you all my money<br />
Just like I did before<br />
I tried to reach you honey<br />
But you're driftin' too far from shore<br />
Driftin' too far from shore<br />
Driftin' too far from shore.<br />
<br />
I ain't gotta get lost in this current<br />
I don't like playing cat and mouse<br />
No gentleman likes making love to a servant<br />
Especially when he's in his fathers house<br />
I never could guess your weight baby<br />
Never needed to call you my whore<br />
I always thought you were straight baby<br />
But you're driftin' too far from shore<br />
Driftin' too far from shore<br />
Driftin' too far from shore.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted<br />
The bottom of the barrel is too<br />
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted<br />
Everybody can't be as lucky as you<br />
Never no more do I wonder<br />
Why you don't never play with me any more<br />
At any moment you could go under<br />
Cause you're driftin' too far from shore<br />
Driftin' too far from shore<br />
Driftin' too far from shore.<br />
<br />
You and me we had completeness<br />
I give you all of what I could provide<br />
We weren't on the wrong side sweetness<br />
We were the wrong side<br />
I've already ripped out the phones honey<br />
You can't walk the streets in a war<br />
I can't finish this alone honey<br />
You're driftin' too far from shore<br />
You're driftin' too far from shore.</p>
