johnny (little johnny)<br />
with his father's hammer<br />
nailed five flies<br />
t' the kitchen window<br />
trapped baby bumblebees<br />
in orange juice bottles<br />
rib whipped his<br />
younger brother<br />
an' stuck his sister's hand<br />
in the garbage disposal<br />
pleasin' johnny<br />
dad's football star<br />
named all the girls<br />
that did it<br />
he did<br />
an' never knew a<br />
one that didn't<br />
bruiser johnny<br />
sore loser johnny<br />
bad in math<br />
but his parents fixed it<br />
got too drunk in bars<br />
an' his parents fixed<br />
that too<br />
lovin' johnny<br />
crew-cut johnny<br />
well molded<br />
clean lived in<br />
something his parents<br />
could be proud of<br />
<br>
no matter what the<br />
cost to him<br />
a structure of a manly duckling<br />
but his parents<br />
couldn't buy him<br />
into the college<br />
where he wanted t' go<br />
genius johnny<br />
poutin' johnny<br />
punchin' johnny<br />
crashed his<br />
here son have a car good boy<br />
cadillac into<br />
a couldn't care less<br />
railroad bridge<br />
his parents supported him still<br />
they bought new hankies<br />
an' johnny got lots of flowers<br />
<br />
an' so as spoked prongs<br />
pierce from perilous heights<br />
plungin'<br />
through soft pillows,<br />
there IS a sound<br />
that rings<br />
no praise<br />
no praise<br />
but you must be<br />
aware of poor johnny<br />
t' hear it</p>
