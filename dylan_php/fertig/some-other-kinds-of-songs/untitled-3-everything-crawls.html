“i could make you crawl<br />
if I was payin attention”<br />
he said munchin a sandwich<br />
in between chess moves<br />
“what d you wanna make<br />
me crawl for?”<br />
“i mean i just could”<br />
“could make me crawl”<br />
“yeah, make you crawl!”<br />
“humm, funny guy you are”<br />
“no, i just play t win,<br />
that's all”<br />
“well if you cant win me,<br />
then you're the worst player<br />
i ever played”<br />
“what d you mean?”<br />
his jaw tightened an he took a deep breath<br />
“hummm, now i gotta beat you”<br />
<br />
straight away an into the ring<br />
juno takes twenty pills an<br />
pants all day. life he says<br />
is a head kinda thing, outside<br />
of chicago, private life come down<br />
junkie nurse home heals countless<br />
common housewives strung out<br />
fully on drugstore dope, legally<br />
sold t help clean the kitchen.<br />
lenny bruce shows his seventh<br />
avenue hand-made movies, while a<br />
bunch of women sneak little white<br />
tablets into shoes, stockings, hats<br />
an other hidin places. newspapers<br />
tell neither. irma goes t israel<br />
an writes me that there, they<br />
hate nazis much more n we over here<br />
do. eichmann dies yes, an west<br />
germany sends eighty-year-old<br />
pruned-out gestapo hermit off t<br />
the penitentiary. in east berlin<br />
renata tells me that i must wear<br />
tie t get in t this certain place<br />
i wanna go. back here, literate<br />
old man with rebel flag above<br />
home sweet home sign says he won't<br />
vote for goldwater. “talks too<br />
much, should keep his mouth shut”<br />
<br />
i walk between backyards an see<br />
little boy with feather in his hair<br />
lyin dead on the grass, he gets<br />
up an' hands feather t another<br />
little boy who immediately falls<br />
down. “it's my turn t be the good<br />
guy . . . take that, redskin” bang bang.<br />
henry miller stands on other side<br />
of ping pong table an keeps<br />
talkin about me. “did you ask<br />
<br>
the poet fellow if he wants<br />
something t drink” he says t<br />
someone gettin all the drinks.<br />
i drop my ping pong paddle<br />
an look at the pool. my worst<br />
enemies don't even put me down<br />
in such a mysterious way.<br />
college student trails me with microphone an tape machine.<br />
what d you think a the communist<br />
party? what communist party?<br />
he rattles off names an numbers.<br />
he can't answer my question. he<br />
tries harder. i say “you don't<br />
have t answer my question” he<br />
gets all squishy. i say<br />
there's no answer t my question<br />
any more n there's an answer t<br />
your question. ferris wheel runs<br />
in california park an the sky trembles.<br />
turns red. above hiccups an pointed<br />
fingers. i tell reporter lady that yes<br />
i'm monstrously against the house<br />
unamerican activities commitee<br />
an also the cia an i beg her please<br />
not t ask me why for it would take<br />
too long t tell she asks me about<br />
humanity an i say i'm not sure<br />
what that word means. she wants me<br />
t say what she wants me t say. she<br />
wants me t say what she<br />
can understand. a loose-tempered fat<br />
man in borrowed stomach slams wife<br />
in the face an rushes off t civil<br />
rights meeting. while some strange<br />
girl chases me up smoky mountain<br />
tryin t find out what sign i am.<br />
i take allen ginsberg t meet fantastic<br />
great beautiful artists an no trespassin<br />
<br />
boards block up all there is t see.<br />
eviction. infection gangrene an<br />
atomic bombs. both ends exist only<br />
because there is someone who wants<br />
profit. boy loses eyesight. becomes<br />
airplane pilot. people pound their<br />
chests an other people's chests an<br />
interpret bibles t suit their<br />
own means. respect is just a misinterpreted word<br />
an if Jesus Christ himself came<br />
down through these streets, Christianity<br />
would start all over again. standin<br />
on the stage of all ground, insects<br />
play in their own world. snakes<br />
slide through the weeds. ants come an<br />
go through the grass. turtles an lizards<br />
make their way through the sand. everything<br />
crawls. everything . . .<br />
an everything still crawls</p>
