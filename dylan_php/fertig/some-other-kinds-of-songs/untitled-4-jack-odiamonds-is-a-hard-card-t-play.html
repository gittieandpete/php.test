jack o'diamonds<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
one-eyed knave<br />
on the move<br />
hits the street<br />
sneaks, leaps<br />
between pillars of chips<br />
springs on them like samson<br />
thumps thumps<br />
strikes<br />
is on the prowl<br />
you'll only lose<br />
shouldn't stay<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
is a hard card t play<br />
<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
wrecked my hand<br />
left me here t stand<br />
little tin men play<br />
their drums now<br />
upside my head<br />
in the midst of cheers<br />
flowers<br />
four queens<br />
with pawed out hearts<br />
make believe<br />
they're still good<br />
but i should drop<br />
fold<br />
an dean martin should apologize<br />
t the rolling stones<br />
ho hum<br />
weird tablestakes<br />
young babies horseback ride<br />
their fathers' necks<br />
two dudes in hopped-up ford<br />
for the tenth time<br />
have rolled through town<br />
it's your turn baby t<br />
cut the deck<br />
on you're goin under<br />
stayed too long<br />
chinese gong<br />
down the way<br />
says jack o'diamonds<br />
(a high card)<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
(but ain't high enough)<br />
<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
is a hard card t play<br />
<br />
jack o'diamonds used t laugh at me<br />
now wants t collect from me<br />
used t be ashamed of me<br />
now wants t walk long side of me<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
one-armed prince<br />
wears but a single glove<br />
as he shoves<br />
<br>
never loves<br />
the moon's too bright<br />
as he's fixed mirrors<br />
round the room at night<br />
it's hard t think<br />
there's probably somethin<br />
in my drink<br />
should pour it out<br />
inside the sink<br />
would throw it in his face<br />
but it'd do no good<br />
give no gain<br />
just leave a stain<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
an all his crap<br />
needs some acid<br />
in his lap<br />
what hour now<br />
it feels late somehow<br />
my hounddog bays<br />
need more ashtrays<br />
i can't even remember<br />
the early days<br />
please don't stay<br />
gather your bells an go<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
(can open for riches)<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
(but then it switches)<br />
a colorful picture but<br />
beats only the ten<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
is a hard card t play<br />
<br />
jack o'diamonds stays indoors<br />
wants me t fight his wars<br />
jack o'diamonds is a hard card t play<br />
never certain. in the middle<br />
commentin' on the songs of birds<br />
chucklin at screamin' mothers<br />
jack o'diamonds drains<br />
fish brains<br />
raffles what's left over<br />
across the table<br />
t little boy card sharks<br />
who just sat down<br />
t get off their feet<br />
back luck run's all in fun<br />
it's your choice. your voice<br />
you choose<br />
you lose<br />
run for cover<br />
hallaluyah<br />
you choose t lose<br />
take yourself<br />
disappear<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
(a king's death)<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
(at the ace's breath)<br />
jack o'diamonds<br />
is a hard card t play</p>
