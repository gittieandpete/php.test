run go get out of here<br />
quick<br />
leave joshua<br />
split<br />
go fit your battle<br />
do your thing<br />
i lost my glasses<br />
can't see jericho<br />
the wind is tyin' knots<br />
in my hair<br />
nothin' seems<br />
t' be straight<br />
out there<br />
no i shan't go with you<br />
i can't go with you<br />
<br />
on the brooklyn bridge<br />
he was cockeyed<br />
an' stood on the edge<br />
there was a priest talkin' to him<br />
i was shiftin' myself around<br />
so i could see from all sides<br />
in an' out of stretched necks<br />
an' things<br />
cops held people back<br />
the lady in back of me<br />
burst into my groin<br />
“sick sick some are so sick”<br />
like a circus trapeze act<br />
“oh i hope he don't do it”<br />
he was on the other side of the railin'<br />
both eyes fiery wide<br />
wet with sweat<br />
the mouth of a shark<br />
rolled up soiled sleeves<br />
his arms were thick an' tattooed<br />
an' he wore a silver watch<br />
i could tell at a glance<br />
he was uselessly lonely<br />
i couldn't stay an' look at him<br />
i couldn't stay an' look at him<br />
because i suddenly realized that<br />
deep in my heart<br />
i really wanted<br />
t' see him jump<br />
<br />
(a mob. each member knowin'<br />
that they all know an' see the same thing<br />
they have the same thing in common.<br />
can stare at each other in total blankness<br />
they do not have t' speak an' not feel guilty<br />
about havin' nothing t' say. everyday boredom<br />
soaked by the temporary happiness<br />
of that their search is finally over<br />
for findin' a way t' communicate a leech cookout<br />
giant cop out. all mobs i would think.<br />
an' i was in it an' caught by the excitement of it)<br />
<br />
an' i walked away<br />
i wanted t' see him jump so bad<br />
that i had t' walk away an' hide<br />
uptown uptown<br />
orchard street<br />
through all those people on<br />
orchard street<br />
pants legs in my face<br />
“comere! comere!”<br />
i don't need no clothes<br />
an' cross the street<br />
skull caps climb<br />
by themselves out of manholes<br />
an' shoeboxes ride<br />
the cracks of the sidewalk<br />
fishermen —<br />
i've suddenly been turned into<br />
a fish<br />
but does anybody<br />
wanna be a fisherman<br />
any more ‘n i<br />
don't wanna be a fish<br />
<br />
(swingin' wanda's<br />
down in new orleans<br />
rumbles across<br />
brick written<br />
swear word<br />
vulgar wall<br />
in new york city)<br />
<br />
no they can't make it<br />
off the banks of their river<br />
<br />
i am in their river<br />
(i wonder if he jumped<br />
i really wonder if he jumped)<br />
i turn corner<br />
t' get off river<br />
an' get off river<br />
still goin' up<br />
i about face<br />
an' discover<br />
that i'm on another river<br />
<br />
(this time. king rex<br />
blesses me with plastic beads<br />
an' toot toot whistles<br />
paper rings an' things.<br />
royal street.<br />
bourbon street<br />
st. claude an' esplanade<br />
pass an' pull<br />
everything out of shape<br />
joe b. stuart<br />
white southern poet<br />
holds me up<br />
we charge through casa<br />
blazin' jukebox<br />
gumbo overflowin'<br />
get kicked out of colored bar<br />
streets jammed<br />
hypnotic stars explode<br />
in louisiana murder night<br />
everything's wedged<br />
arm in arm<br />
stoned galore<br />
must see you in mobile then<br />
down governor nichel<br />
an' gone)<br />
<br />
ok i can get off this river too<br />
on bleeker street<br />
i meet many friends<br />
who look back at me<br />
as if they know something<br />
i don't know<br />
<br />
rocco an' his brothers<br />
say that some people<br />
are worse hung up than me<br />
i don't wanna hear it<br />
a basketball drops through<br />
the hoop<br />
an' i recall that the<br />
living theater's been busted<br />
<br />
(has the guy jumped yet?)<br />
intellectual spiders<br />
weave down sixth avenue<br />
with colt forty-fives<br />
stickin' out of their<br />
belly buttons<br />
an' for the first time<br />
in my life<br />
<br>
i'm proud that<br />
i haven't read into<br />
any masterpiece books<br />
(an' why did i wanna see that<br />
poor soul so dead?)<br />
<br />
first of all two people get<br />
together an' they want their doors<br />
<br />
enlarged. second of all, more<br />
people see what's happenin' an'<br />
come t' help with the door<br />
enlargement. the ones that arrive<br />
however have nothin' more than<br />
“let's get these doors enlarged”<br />
t' say t' the ones who were<br />
there in the first place. it follows then that<br />
the whole thing revolves around<br />
nothing but this door enlargement idea.<br />
third of all, there's a group now existin'<br />
an' the only thing that keeps them friends<br />
is that they all want the doors enlarged.<br />
obviously, the doors're then enlarged<br />
fourth of all,<br />
after this enlargement<br />
the group has t' find<br />
something else t' keep<br />
them together or<br />
else the door enlargement<br />
will prove t' be<br />
embarrassing<br />
<br />
on fourteenth street<br />
i meet someone<br />
who i know in front<br />
wants t' put me<br />
uptight<br />
wants me t' be on<br />
his level<br />
in all honesty<br />
he wants t' drag<br />
me down there<br />
i realize gravity<br />
is my only enemy<br />
loneliness has clutched<br />
hands an' squeezes you<br />
into wrongin' others<br />
everybody has t' do things<br />
keep themselves occupied<br />
the workin' ones<br />
have their minds on<br />
the weekends<br />
victims of the system<br />
pack movie theaters<br />
an' who an' of what<br />
sadistic company is he<br />
from that has the right<br />
t' condemn others as trivial<br />
whose fault<br />
an' who really is t' blame<br />
for one man carryin' a gun<br />
it is impossible that<br />
it's him<br />
slaves are of no special color<br />
an' the links of chains<br />
fall into no special order<br />
how good an actor do you have to be<br />
and play God<br />
<br />
(in greece, a little old lady<br />
a worker lady<br />
looks at me<br />
rubs her chin<br />
an' by sign language asks<br />
how come i'm so unshaven<br />
“the sea is very beautiful here”<br />
<br />
i reply<br />
pointin' t' my chin.<br />
an' she believes me<br />
needs no other answer<br />
i strum the guitar<br />
she dances<br />
laughs<br />
her bandana flies<br />
i too realize that<br />
she will die here<br />
one the side of this sea<br />
her death is certain here<br />
my death is unknown<br />
an' i come t' think that<br />
i love her)<br />
<br />
i talk t' people every day<br />
involved in some scene<br />
good an' evil are but words<br />
invented by those<br />
that are trapped in scenes<br />
<br />
on what grounds are the<br />
grounds for judgment<br />
an i think also<br />
that there is not<br />
one thing anyplace<br />
anywhere that makes any<br />
sense. there are only tears<br />
an' there is only sorrow<br />
there are no problems<br />
<br />
i have seen what i've loved<br />
slip away an' vanish. i still<br />
love what i've lost but t' run<br />
an' try t' catch it'd<br />
be very greedy<br />
for the rest of my life<br />
i will never chase a livin' soul<br />
into the prison grasp<br />
of my own self-love<br />
<br />
i can't believe that i have<br />
t' hate anybody<br />
an' when i do<br />
it will only be out of fear<br />
an' i'll know it<br />
<br />
i know no answers an' no truth<br />
for absolutely no soul alive<br />
i will listen t' no one<br />
who tells me morals<br />
there are no morals<br />
an' i dream a lot<br />
<br />
so go joshua<br />
go fit your battle<br />
i have t' go t' the woods<br />
for a while<br />
i hope you understand<br />
but if you don't<br />
it doesn't matter<br />
i will be with you<br />
nex' time around<br />
don't think about me<br />
i'll be ok<br />
just go ahead out there<br />
right out there<br />
do what you say<br />
you're gonna do<br />
an' who knows<br />
someday<br />
someone might even<br />
write<br />
a song<br />
about you</p>
