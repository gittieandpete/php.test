i used t' hate enzo<br />
i used t' hate him<br />
so much that i could've killed him<br />
he was rotten an' ruthless<br />
an' after what he could get<br />
i was sure of that<br />
my beloved one met him<br />
in a far-off land<br />
an' she stayed longer there<br />
because of him<br />
i croaked with exhaustion<br />
that he was actually makin' her happy<br />
i never knew him<br />
sometimes i would see him<br />
<br>
on my ceilin'<br />
i could've shot him<br />
the rovin' phony<br />
the romantic idiot<br />
i know about guys for<br />
i myself am a guy<br />
poison swings its pendulums<br />
with a seasick sensation<br />
an' i used t' want t' trample on him<br />
i used t' want t' massacre him<br />
i used t' want t' murder him<br />
i wanted t' be like him so much<br />
that i ached<br />
i used t' hate enzo</p>
