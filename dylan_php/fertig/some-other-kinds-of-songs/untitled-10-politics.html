you tell me about politics<br />
this that<br />
you speak of rats.<br />
geese. a world of peace<br />
you stumble stammer<br />
pound your fist<br />
an' i tell you there are no politics<br />
you swear<br />
tell me how much you care<br />
you cheat the lunch counter man<br />
out of a pack of cigarettes<br />
an' i tell you there are no politics<br />
you tell me of goons'<br />
graves. ginks an' finks<br />
an' of what you've read<br />
an' how things should be<br />
an' what you'd do if . . .<br />
an i say someone's been<br />
tamperin' with your head<br />
you jump<br />
raise your voice<br />
an' gyrate yourself<br />
t' the tone of principles<br />
your arm is raised<br />
an' i tell you there are no politics<br />
in the afternoon you run<br />
t' keep appointments<br />
with false lovers<br />
an' this leaves you<br />
drained by nightfall<br />
you ask me questions<br />
an' i say that every question<br />
if it's a truthful question<br />
can be answered by askin' it<br />
you stomp<br />
get mad<br />
i say it's got nothin' t' do with<br />
gertrude stein<br />
you turn your eyes<br />
t' the radio<br />
an' tell me what a<br />
wasteland exists in television<br />
you rant an' rave<br />
of poverty<br />
your fingers crawl the walls<br />
the screen door leaves black marks<br />
across your nose<br />
your breath remains on<br />
window glass<br />
bullfight posters hang crooked above your head<br />
an' the phone rings constantly<br />
<br>
you tell me how much i've changed<br />
as if that is all there is t' say<br />
out of the side of your mouth<br />
while talkin' on the wires<br />
in a completely different<br />
tone of voice<br />
than you had a minute ago<br />
when speakin' t' me about something else<br />
i say what's this about changes?<br />
you say “let's go get drunk”<br />
light a cigarette<br />
“an' throw up on the world”<br />
you go t' your closet<br />
mumblin' about the phoniness of churches<br />
an' spastic national leaders<br />
i say groovy but<br />
also holy hollowness too<br />
yes hollow holiness<br />
an' that some of my best friends<br />
know people that go t' church<br />
you blow up<br />
slam doors<br />
say “can't no one say nothin' t' you”<br />
s say “what do You think?”<br />
your face laughs<br />
you say “oh yeeeeeaah?”<br />
i'm gonna break up i say<br />
an' reach for your coat<br />
‘neath piles of paper slogans<br />
i say your house is dirty<br />
you say you should talk<br />
your hallway stinks as<br />
we walk through it<br />
your stairs tilt drastically<br />
your railing's rotted<br />
an' there's blood at the<br />
bottom of your steps<br />
you say t' meet bricks with bricks<br />
i say t' meet bricks with chalk<br />
you tell me monster floor plans<br />
an' i tell you about a bookie shop<br />
in boston givin' odds on the presidential<br />
race<br />
i'm not gonna bet for a while i say<br />
little children<br />
shoot craps<br />
in the alley garbage pot<br />
you say “nothin's perfect”<br />
an' i tell you again<br />
there are no<br />
politics</p>
