Of war and peace the truth just twists<br />
Its curfew gull just glides<br />
Upon four-legged forest clouds<br />
The cowboy angel rides<br />
With his candle lit into the sun<br />
Though its glow is waxed in black<br />
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.<br />
<br />
The lamppost stands with folded arms<br />
Its iron claws attached<br />
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail<br />
Though it shadows metal badge<br />
All and all can only fall<br />
With a crashing but meaningless blow<br />
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden.<br />
<br />
The savage soldiers sticks his head in sand<br />
And then complains<br />
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf<br />
But still remains<br />
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay<br />
At ships with tatooed sails<br />
Heading for the Gates of Eden.<br />
<br />
With a time-rusted compass blade<br />
Alladin and his lamp<br />
Sits with Utopian hermit monks<br />
Side saddle on the Golden Calf<br />
And on their promises of paradise<br />
You will not hear a laugh<br />
All except inside the Gates of Eden.<br />
<br />
Relationships of ownership<br />
They whisper in the wings<br />
To those condemned to act accordingly <br />
<br>
And wait for succeeding kings<br />
And I will try to harmonize with songs<br />
The lonesome sparrow sings<br />
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden.<br />
<br />
The motorcycle black madonna<br />
Two-wheeled gypsy queen<br />
And her silver-studded phantom cause<br />
The gray flannel dwarf to scream<br />
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey<br />
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins<br />
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden.<br />
<br />
The kingdoms of Experience<br />
In the precious wind they rot<br />
While paupers change possessions<br />
Each one wishing for what the other has got<br />
And the princess and the prince<br />
Discuss what's real and what is not<br />
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden.<br />
<br />
The foreign sun, it squints upon <br />
A bed that is never mine<br />
As friends and other strangers<br />
From their fates try to resign<br />
Leaving men wholly totally free<br />
To do anything they wish to do but die<br />
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden.<br />
<br />
At dawn my lower comes to me<br />
And tells me of her dreams<br />
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse<br />
Into the ditch of what each one means<br />
At times I think there are no words<br />
But these to tell what's true<br />
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden.</p>
