I was riding on the Mayflower<br />
When I thought I spied some land<br />
I yelled for Captain Arab<br />
I have yuh understand<br />
Who came running to the deck<br />
Said, "Boys, forget the whale<br />
Look on over yonder<br />
Cut the engines<br />
Change the sail<br />
Haul on the bowline"<br />
We sang that melody<br />
Like all tough sailors do<br />
When they are far away at sea.<br />
<br />
"I think I'll call it America"<br />
I said as we hit the land<br />
I took a deep breath<br />
I fell down, I could not stand<br />
Captain Arab he started<br />
Writing up some deeds<br />
He said, "Let's set up a fort<br />
And start buying the place with beads"<br />
Just then this cop comes down the street<br />
Crazy as a loon<br />
He throw us all in jail<br />
For carryin' harpoons.<br />
<br />
Ah me I busted out<br />
Don't even ask me how<br />
I went to get some help<br />
I walked by a Guernsey cow<br />
Who directed me down<br />
To the Bowery slums<br />
Where people carried signs around<br />
Saying, "Ban the bums"<br />
I jumped right into line<br />
Sayin' "I hope that I'm not late"<br />
When I realized I hadn't eaten<br />
For five days straight.<br />
<br />
I went into a restaurant<br />
Lookin' for the cook<br />
I told him I was the editor<br />
Of a famous etiquette book<br />
The waitress he was handsome<br />
He wore a powder blue cape<br />
I ordered some suzette, I said<br />
"Could you please make that crepe"<br />
Just then the whole kitchen exploded<br />
From boillin' fat<br />
Food was flying anywhere<br />
And I left without my had.<br />
<br />
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy<br />
But I went into a bank<br />
To get some bail for Arab<br />
And all the boys back in the tank<br />
They asked me for some collateral<br />
And I pulled down my pants<br />
They threw me in the alley<br />
When up comes this girl from France<br />
Who invited me to her house<br />
I went, but she had a friend<br />
Who knocked me out<br />
And robbed my boots<br />
And I was on the street again.<br />
<br />
Well, I rapped upon a house<br />
With the US flag upon display<br />
I said, "Could you help me out<br />
I got some friends down the way<br />
" The man says, "Get out of here<br />
I'll tear you limp from limb"<br />
<br>
I said, "You know they refused Jesus, too"<br />
He said, "You're not Him<br />
Get out of here before I break your bones<br />
I ain't your pop"<br />
I decided to have him arrested<br />
And I went lookin for a cop.<br />
<br />
I ran right outside<br />
And I hopped inside a cab<br />
I went out the other door<br />
This Englishman said, "Fab"<br />
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand<br />
And a chariot that stood<br />
Parked across from a building<br />
Advertising brotherhood<br />
I ran right through the front door<br />
Like a hobo sailor does<br />
But it was just a funeral parlor<br />
And the man asked me who I was. <br />
<br />
I repeated that my friends<br />
Where all in jail, with a sigh<br />
He gave me his card<br />
He said, "Call me if they die"<br />
I shook his hand and said goodbye<br />
Ran out to the street<br />
When a bowling ball came down the road<br />
And knocked me off my feet<br />
A pay phone was ringing<br />
It just about blew my mind<br />
When I picked it up and said hello<br />
This foot came through the line.<br />
<br />
Well, by this time I was feed up<br />
At tryin'g to make a stab<br />
At bringin' back any help<br />
For my friends and captain Arab<br />
I decided to flip a coin<br />
Like either heads or tails<br />
Would let me know if I should go<br />
Back to the ship or back to jail<br />
So I hooked my sailor suit<br />
And I got a coin to flip<br />
It came up tails<br />
It rhymed with sails<br />
So I made it back to the ship.<br />
<br />
Well, I got back and took<br />
The parkin' ticket off the mast<br />
I was ripping it to shreds<br />
When this coastguard boat went past<br />
They asked me my name<br />
And I said, "Captain Kidd"<br />
They believed me but<br />
They wanted to know<br />
What exactly that I did<br />
I said for the Pope of Eruke<br />
I was employed<br />
They let me go right away<br />
They were very paranoid.<br />
<br />
Well, the last I heard of Arab<br />
He was stuck on a whale<br />
That was married to the deputy<br />
Sheriff of the jail<br />
But the funniest thing was<br />
When I was leavin' the bay<br />
I saw three ships a-sailin'<br />
There were all heading my way<br />
I asked the captain what his name was<br />
And how come he didn't drive a truck<br />
He said his name was Columbus<br />
I just said, "Good luck".</p>
