Ain't it hard to stumble<br />
And land in some funny lagoon ?<br />
Ain't it hard to stumble<br />
And land in some muddy lagoon ?<br />
Especially when it's nine below zero<br />
And three o'clock in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
Ain't gonna hang no picturev<br />
Ain't gonna hang no picture frame<br />
Ain't gonna hang no picture<br />
Ain't gonna hang no picture frame<br />
Well, I might look like Robert Ford<br />
But I feel just like a Jesse James.<br />
<br />
Well, I wish I was on some<br />
Australian mountain range<br />
Oh, I wish I was on some<br />
<br>
Australian mountain range<br />
I got no reason to be there, but I<br />
Imagine it would be some kind of change.<br />
<br />
I got my dark sunglasses<br />
I got for good luck my black tooth<br />
I got my dark sunglasses<br />
I'm carryin' for good luck my black tooth<br />
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'<br />
I just might tell you the truth.<br />
<br />
I got a woman in Jackson<br />
I ain't gonna say her name<br />
I got a woman in Jackson<br />
I ain't gonna say her name<br />
She's a brown-skin woman, but I<br />
Love her just the same.</p>
