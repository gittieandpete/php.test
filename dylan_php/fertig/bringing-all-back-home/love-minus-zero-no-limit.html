My love, she speaks like silence<br />
Without ideals or violence<br />
She doesn't have to say she's faithful<br />
Yet she's true like ice, like fire<br />
People carry roses<br />
And make promises by the hour<br />
My love she laughs like the flowers<br />
Valentines can't buy her<br />
<br />
In the dime stores and bus stations<br />
People talk of situations<br />
Read books, repeat quotations<br />
Draw conclusions on the wall<br />
Some speak of the future<br />
My love, she speaks softly<br />
She knows there's no success like failure<br />
And that failure's no success at all<br />
<br>
<br />
The cloak and dagger dangles<br />
Madams light the candles<br />
In ceremonies of the horsemen<br />
Even the pawn must hold a grudge<br />
Statues made of matchsticks<br />
Crumble into one another<br />
My love winks she does not bother<br />
She knows too much to argue or to judge<br />
<br />
The bridge at midnight trembles<br />
The country doctor rambles<br />
Bankers' nieces seek perfection<br />
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring<br />
The wind howls like a hammer<br />
The night wind blows cold n' rainy<br />
My love, she's like some raven<br />
At my window with a broken wing</p>
