When she said,<br />
&quot;don't waste your words, they're just lies,&quot;<br />
I cried she was deaf.<br />
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,<br />
Then said, &quot;what else you got left?&quot;<br />
It was then that i got up to leave<br />
But she said, &quot;don't forget,<br />
Everybody must give something back<br />
For something they get.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stood there and hummed,<br />
I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.<br />
And she buttoned her boot,<br />
And straightened her suit,<br />
Then she said, &quot;don't get cute.&quot;<br />
So i forced my hands in my pockets<br />
And felt with my thumbs,<br />
And gallantly handed her<br />
My very last piece of gum.<br />
<br />
She threw me outside,<br />
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.<br />
And after finding i'd<br />
Forgotten my shirt,<br />
I went back and knocked.<br />
<br>
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,<br />
And i tried to make sense<br />
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair<br />
That leaned up against . . .<br />
<br />
Her jamaican rum<br />
And when she did come, i asked her for some.<br />
She said, &quot;no, dear.&quot;<br />
I said, &quot;your words aren't clear,<br />
You'd better spit out your gum.&quot;<br />
She screamed till her face got so red<br />
Then she fell on the floor,<br />
And i covered her up and then<br />
Thought i'd go look through her drawer.<br />
<br />
And, when i was through<br />
I filled up my shoe<br />
And brought it to you.<br />
And you, you took me in,<br />
You loved me then<br />
You didn't waste time.<br />
And i, i never took much,<br />
I never asked for your crutch.<br />
Now don't ask for mine.<br />
