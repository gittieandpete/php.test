Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?<br />
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it<br />
And louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it<br />
Lights flicker from the opposite loft<br />
In this room the heat pipes just cough<br />
The country music station plays soft<br />
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off<br />
Just louise and her lover so entwined<br />
And these visions of johanna that conquer my mind<br />
<br />
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain<br />
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the &quot;d&quot; train<br />
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight<br />
Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane<br />
Louise, she's all right, she's just near<br />
She's delicate and seems like the mirror<br />
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear<br />
That johanna's not here<br />
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face<br />
Where these visions of johanna have now taken my place<br />
<br />
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously<br />
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously<br />
And when bringing her name up<br />
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me<br />
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all<br />
Muttering small talk at the wall while i'm in the hall<br />
How can i explain?<br />
<br>
Oh, it's so hard to get on<br />
And these visions of johanna, they kept me up past the dawn<br />
<br />
Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial<br />
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while<br />
But mona lisa musta had the highway blues<br />
You can tell by the way she smiles<br />
See the primitive wallflower freeze<br />
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze<br />
Hear the one with the mustache say, &quot;jeeze<br />
I can't find my knees&quot;<br />
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule<br />
But these visions of johanna, they make it all seem so cruel<br />
<br />
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him<br />
Sayin', &quot;name me someone that's not a parasite and i'll go out and say a prayer for him&quot;<br />
But like louise always says<br />
&quot;ya can't look at much, can ya man?&quot;<br />
As she, herself, prepares for him<br />
And madonna, she still has not showed<br />
We see this empty cage now corrode<br />
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed<br />
The fiddler, he now steps to the road<br />
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed<br />
On the back of the fish truck that loads<br />
While my conscience explodes<br />
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain<br />
And these visions of johanna are now all that remain<br />
