She's got everything she needs,<br />
She's an artist, she don't look back.<br />
She's got everything she needs,<br />
She's an artist, she don't look back.<br />
She can take the dark out of the nighttime<br />
And paint the daytime black.<br />
<br />
You will start out standing<br />
Proud to steal her anything she sees.<br />
You will start out standing<br />
Proud to steal her anything she sees.<br />
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole<br />
Down upon your knees.<br />
<br />
She never stumbles,<br />
She's got no place to fall.<br />
She never stumbles,<br />
<br>
She's got no place to fall.<br />
She's nobody's child,<br />
The law can't touch her at all.<br />
<br />
She wears an egyptian ring<br />
That sparkles before she speaks.<br />
She wears an egyptian ring<br />
That sparkles before she speaks.<br />
She's a hypnotist collector,<br />
You are a walking antique.<br />
<br />
Bow down to her on sunday,<br />
Salute her when her birthday comes.<br />
Bow down to her on sunday,<br />
Salute her when her birthday comes.<br />
For halloween give her a trumpet<br />
And for christmas, buy her a drum.<br />
