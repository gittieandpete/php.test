They're selling postcards of the hanging<br />
They're painting the passports brown<br />
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors<br />
The circus is in town<br />
Here comes the blind commissioner<br />
They've got him in a trance<br />
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker<br />
The other is in his pants<br />
And the riot squad they're restless<br />
They need somewhere to go<br />
As lady and i look out tonight<br />
From desolation row<br />
<br />
Cinderella, she seems so easy<br />
&quot;it takes one to know one,&quot; she smiles<br />
And puts her hands in her back pockets<br />
Bette davis style<br />
And in comes romeo, he's moaning<br />
&quot;you belong to me i believe&quot;<br />
And someone says,&quot; you're in the wrong place, my friend<br />
You better leave&quot;<br />
And the only sound that's left<br />
After the ambulances go<br />
Is cinderella sweeping up<br />
On desolation row<br />
<br />
Now the moon is almost hidden<br />
The stars are beginning to hide<br />
The fortunetelling lady<br />
Has even taken all her things inside<br />
All except for cain and abel<br />
And the hunchback of notre dame<br />
Everybody is making love<br />
Or else expecting rain<br />
And the good samaritan, he's dressing<br />
He's getting ready for the show<br />
He's going to the carnival tonight<br />
On desolation row<br />
<br />
Now ophelia, she's 'neath the window<br />
For her i feel so afraid<br />
On her twenty-second birthday<br />
She already is an old maid<br />
<br />
To her, death is quite romantic<br />
She wears an iron vest<br />
Her profession's her religion<br />
Her sin is her lifelessness<br />
And though her eyes are fixed upon<br />
Noah's great rainbow<br />
She spends her time peeking<br />
Into desolation row<br />
<br />
Einstein, disguised as robin hood<br />
With his memories in a trunk<br />
Passed this way an hour ago<br />
With his friend, a jealous monk<br />
He looked so immaculately frightful<br />
As he bummed a cigarette<br />
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes<br />
And reciting the alphabet<br />
Now you would not think to look at him<br />
But he was famous long ago<br />
For playing the electric violin<br />
On desolation row<br />
<br />
<br>
Dr. filth, he keeps his world<br />
Inside of a leather cup<br />
But all his sexless patients<br />
They're trying to blow it up<br />
Now his nurse, some local loser<br />
She's in charge of the cyanide hole<br />
And she also keeps the cards that read<br />
&quot;have mercy on his soul&quot;<br />
They all play on penny whistles<br />
You can hear them blow<br />
If you lean your head out far enough<br />
From desolation row<br />
<br />
Across the street they've nailed the curtains<br />
They're getting ready for the feast<br />
The phantom of the opera<br />
A perfect image of a priest<br />
They're spoonfeeding casanova<br />
To get him to feel more assured<br />
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence<br />
After poisoning him with words<br />
<br />
And the phantom's shouting to skinny girls<br />
&quot;get outa here if you don't know<br />
Casanova is just being punished for going<br />
To desolation row&quot;<br />
<br />
Now at midnight all the agents<br />
And the superhuman crew<br />
Come out and round up everyone<br />
That knows more than they do<br />
Then they bring them to the factory<br />
Where the heart-attack machine<br />
Is strapped across their shoulders<br />
And then the kerosene<br />
Is brought down from the castles<br />
By insurance men who go<br />
Check to see that nobody is escaping<br />
To desolation row<br />
<br />
Praise be to nero's neptune<br />
The titanic sails at dawn<br />
And everybody's shouting<br />
&quot;which side are you on?&quot;<br />
And ezra pound and t. s. eliot<br />
Fighting in the captain's tower<br />
While calypso singers laugh at them<br />
And fishermen hold flowers<br />
Between the windows of the sea<br />
Where lovely mermaids flow<br />
And nobody has to think too much<br />
About desolation row<br />
<br />
Yes, i received your letter yesterday<br />
(about the time the door knob broke)<br />
When you asked how i was doing<br />
Was that some kind of joke?<br />
All these people that you mention<br />
Yes, i know them, they're quite lame<br />
I had to rearrange their faces<br />
And give them all another name<br />
Right now i can't read too good<br />
Don't send me no more letters no<br />
Not unless you mail them<br />
From desolation row<br />
