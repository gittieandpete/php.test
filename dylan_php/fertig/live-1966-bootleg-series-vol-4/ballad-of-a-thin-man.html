You walk into the room<br />
With your pencil in your hand<br />
You see somebody naked<br />
And you say, &quot;who is that man?&quot;<br />
You try so hard<br />
But you don't understand<br />
Just what you'll say<br />
When you get home<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, mister jones?<br />
<br />
You raise up your head<br />
And you ask, &quot;is this where it is?&quot;<br />
And somebody points to you and says<br />
&quot;it's his&quot;<br />
And you say, &quot;what's mine?&quot;<br />
And somebody else says, &quot;where what is?&quot;<br />
And you say, &quot;oh my god<br />
Am i here all alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, mister jones?<br />
<br />
You hand in your ticket<br />
And you go watch the geek<br />
Who immediately walks up to you<br />
When he hears you speak<br />
And says, &quot;how does it feel<br />
To be such a freak?&quot;<br />
And you say, &quot;impossible&quot;<br />
As he hands you a bone<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, mister jones?<br />
<br />
You have many contacts<br />
Among the lumberjacks<br />
To get you facts<br />
When someone attacks your imagination<br />
But nobody has any respect<br />
Anyway they already expect you<br />
To just give a check<br />
To tax-deductible charity organizations<br />
<br />
You've been with the professors<br />
And they've all liked your looks<br />
<br>
With great lawyers you have<br />
Discussed lepers and crooks<br />
You've been through all of<br />
F. scott fitzgerald's books<br />
You're very well read<br />
It's well known<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, mister jones?<br />
<br />
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you<br />
And then he kneels<br />
He crosses himself<br />
And then he clicks his high heels<br />
And without further notice<br />
He asks you how it feels<br />
And he says, &quot;here is your throat back<br />
Thanks for the loan&quot;<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, mister jones?<br />
<br />
Now you see this one-eyed midget<br />
Shouting the word &quot;now&quot;<br />
And you say, &quot;for what reason?&quot;<br />
And he says, &quot;how?&quot;<br />
And you say, &quot;what does this mean?&quot;<br />
And he screams back, &quot;you're a cow<br />
Give me some milk<br />
Or else go home&quot;<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, mister jones?<br />
<br />
Well, you walk into the room<br />
Like a camel and then you frown<br />
You put your eyes in your pocket<br />
And your nose on the ground<br />
There ought to be a law<br />
Against you comin' around<br />
You should be made<br />
To wear earphones<br />
<br />
Because something is happening here<br />
But you don't know what it is<br />
Do you, mister jones?<br />
