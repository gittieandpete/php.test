Down the street the dogs are barkin'<br />
And the day is a-gettin' dark.<br />
As the night comes in a-fallin',<br />
The dogs 'll lose their bark.<br />
An' the silent night will shatter<br />
From the sounds inside my mind,<br />
For i'm one too many mornings<br />
And a thousand miles behind.<br />
<br />
From the crossroads of my doorstep,<br />
My eyes they start to fade,<br />
As i turn my head back to the room<br />
Where my love and i have laid.<br />
<br>
An' i gaze back to the street,<br />
The sidewalk and the sign,<br />
And i'm one too many mornings<br />
An' a thousand miles behind.<br />
<br />
It's a restless hungry feeling<br />
That don't mean no one no good,<br />
When ev'rything i'm a-sayin'<br />
You can say it just as good.<br />
You're right from your side,<br />
I'm right from mine.<br />
We're both just too many mornings<br />
An' a thousand miles behind.<br />
