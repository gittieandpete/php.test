When you're lost in the rain in juarez<br />
And it's eastertime too<br />
And your gravity fails<br />
And negativity don't pull you through<br />
Don't put on any airs<br />
When you're down on rue morgue avenue<br />
They got some hungry women there<br />
And they really make a mess outa you<br />
<br />
Now if you see saint annie<br />
Please tell her thanks a lot<br />
I cannot move<br />
My fingers are all in a knot<br />
I don't have the strength<br />
To get up and take another shot<br />
And my best friend, my doctor<br />
Won't even say what it is i've got<br />
<br />
Sweet melinda<br />
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom<br />
She speaks good english<br />
And she invites you up into her room<br />
And you're so kind<br />
And careful not to go to her too soon<br />
And she takes your voice<br />
And leaves you howling at the moon<br />
<br />
<br>
Up on housing project hill<br />
It's either fortune or fame<br />
You must pick up one or the other<br />
Though neither of them are to be what they claim<br />
If you're lookin' to get silly<br />
You better go back to from where you came<br />
Because the cops don't need you<br />
And man they expect the same<br />
<br />
Now all the authorities<br />
They just stand around and boast<br />
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms<br />
Into leaving his post<br />
And picking up angel who<br />
Just arrived here from the coast<br />
Who looked so fine at first<br />
But left looking just like a ghost<br />
<br />
I started out on burgundy<br />
But soon hit the harder stuff<br />
Everybody said they'd stand behind me<br />
When the game got rough<br />
But the joke was on me<br />
There was nobody even there to call my bluff<br />
I'm going back to new york city<br />
I do believe i've had enough<br />
