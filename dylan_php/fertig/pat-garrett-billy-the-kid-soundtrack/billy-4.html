There's guns across the river about to pound you<br />
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you<br />
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you<br />
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.<br />
<br />
Camping out all night on the veranda<br />
Walking in the streets down by the hacienda<br />
Up to boot hill the like to send you<br />
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.<br />
<br />
There's mills inside the minds of crazy faces<br />
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases<br />
There is always one more notch in four more aces<br />
Billy, and you're playing all alone.<br />
<br />
Playing around with some sweet signorita<br />
Into her dark chamber she will greet you<br />
In the shadows of the maizes she will lead you<br />
Billy, and you're going all alone.<br />
<br />
They say that pat garrett's got your number<br />
So sleep with one eye open, when you wander<br />
Every little sound just might be thunder<br />
<br>
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.<br />
<br />
There's always another stranger sneaking glances<br />
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances<br />
Some old whore from san pedro'll make advances<br />
Advances on your spirit and your soul.<br />
<br />
The businessmen from taos want you to go down<br />
So they've hired mister garrett, he'll force you to slow down<br />
Billy, don't let it make you feel so low down<br />
To be hunted by the man who was your friend.<br />
<br />
So hang on to your woman, if you got one<br />
Remember in el paso once you shot one<br />
I'll be in santa fe about one<br />
Billy, you've been running for so long.<br />
<br />
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale<br />
Way down in some tularosa alley<br />
Maybe in la rio pecas valley<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home<br />
