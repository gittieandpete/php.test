There's guns across the river aimin' at ya<br />
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya<br />
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya<br />
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.<br />
<br />
Campin' out all night on the berenda<br />
Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda<br />
Up to boot hill they'd like to send ya<br />
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.<br />
<br />
Playin' around with some sweet senorita<br />
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya<br />
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home.<br />
<br />
There's eyes behind the mirrors in empty places<br />
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces<br />
There's always one more notch and ten more paces<br />
Billy, and you're walkin' all alone.<br />
<br />
They say that pat garrett's got your number<br />
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber<br />
Every little sound just might be thunder<br />
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.<br />
<br />
<br>
Guitars will play your grand finale<br />
Down in some tularosa alley,<br />
Maybe in the rio pecos valley<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home.<br />
<br />
There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances<br />
Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances<br />
And some old whore from san pedro to make advances<br />
Advances on your spirit and your soul.<br />
<br />
The businessmen from taos want you to go down<br />
They've hired pat garrett to force a showdown.<br />
Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down<br />
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?<br />
<br />
Hang on to your woman if you got one<br />
Remember in el paso, once, you shot one.<br />
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one<br />
Billy, you been runnin' for so long.<br />
<br />
Guitars will play your grand finale<br />
Down in some tularosa alley<br />
Maybe in the rio pecos valley<br />
Billy, you're so far away from home.<br />
