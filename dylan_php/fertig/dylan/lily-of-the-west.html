When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find<br />
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind<br />
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast<br />
And the name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west.<br />
<br />
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find<br />
But she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind<br />
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest<br />
Then go, my lovely Flora, the lily of the west.<br />
<br />
Away down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree<br />
Conversin' with my Flora there, it seemed so strange to me<br />
<br>
And the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress<br />
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west.<br />
<br />
I stepped up my rival, dagger in my hand <br />
I seized him by the collar, and bodly made him stand<br />
Seing mad by desperation I pierced him to the breast<br />
All this for lovely Flora, the lily of the west.<br />
<br />
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea<br />
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me<br />
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest<br />
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the west.</p>
