I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you in worn out shoes<br />
Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants, that old soft shoe<br />
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, will he likely touch down ?<br />
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.<br />
<br />
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was down and out<br />
He looked to me to be the eye of age as he spoke right out<br />
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughing slapped his leg stale<br />
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.<br />
<br />
<br>
He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell<br />
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh he jumped so high and he clicked<br />
Up his heels<br />
He let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around<br />
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance.<br />
<br />
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughtout the south<br />
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him but just travelled all about<br />
Hid dog up and died, he up and died, and after 20 years he still grieves<br />
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.</p>
