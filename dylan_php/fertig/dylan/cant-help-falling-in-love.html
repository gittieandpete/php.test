Wise men say only fools rush in<br />
But I can't help falling in love with you.<br />
Shall I stay, will it be a sin<br />
If I can't help falling in love with you?<br />
<br />
Like a river flows surely to the sea<br />
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.<br />
<br>
Take my hand, take my whole life too<br />
For I can't help falling in love with you.<br />
<br />
Like a river flows surely to the sea<br />
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.<br />
Take my hand, take my whole life too<br />
For I can't help falling in love with you.</p>
