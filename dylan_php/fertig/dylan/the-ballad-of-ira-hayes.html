Gather round you people and a story I will tell<br />
About a brave young Indian you should remember well<br />
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band<br />
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land<br />
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed<br />
Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed<br />
Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms wene crops of weeds<br />
But when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed<br />
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war<br />
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.<br />
<br />
They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men<br />
But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again<br />
And when the fight was over and the old glory raised<br />
One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes<br />
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war<br />
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.<br />
<br />
Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land<br />
<br>
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand<br />
But he was just a Pima Indian, no money crops, no chance<br />
And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian's dance<br />
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war<br />
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.<br />
<br />
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home<br />
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone<br />
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save<br />
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes<br />
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war<br />
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.<br />
<br />
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry<br />
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died<br />
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war<br />
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore<br />
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.</p>
