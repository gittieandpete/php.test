Now and then there's a fool such as I<br />
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye<br />
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry<br />
When you are gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by<br />
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.<br />
<br />
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you<br />
You taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue<br />
I am a fool but I love you, dear, yes I will until the day I die.<br />
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.<br />
<br />
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye<br />
<br>
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry<br />
When you are gone, when you are gone, I will dream a little <br />
I will dream as years go by<br />
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.<br />
<br />
Now and then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you<br />
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through<br />
I am a fool, yes, but I love you dear, I will love you dear<br />
Till the day, till the day I die<br />
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.<br />
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.<br />
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.</p>
