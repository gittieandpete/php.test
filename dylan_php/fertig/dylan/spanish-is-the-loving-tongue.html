Broke my heart, lost my soul<br />
Adios, mi corazon<br />
Spanish is the loving tongue<br />
Soft as music, light as spring<br />
It was a girl I learned it from<br />
Living down Sonora way<br />
Well, I don't look much like a lover<br />
Still I say her love words over<br />
Mostly when I'm all alone<br />
Mi amor, mi cora sole.<br />
<br />
Haven't seen her since that night<br />
I can't cross the line you know<br />
<br>
They want me for a gamblin' fight<br />
Like as not it's better so<br />
Still I always kind of missed her<br />
Since that last sad night I kissed her<br />
Broke her heart, lost my own<br />
Adios, mi cora sole<br />
Broke her heart, lost my own<br />
Adios, mi cora sole<br />
Adios, mi cora sole<br />
Adios, mi cora sole.<br />
<br />
<br />
