It don't hurt anymore, all my teardrops have dried<br />
No more walking the floor with that burning inside<br />
Just to think it could be, time has opened the door<br />
And at last I am free, I don't hurt anymore No use to deny, I wanted to die the day you said we were through<br />
But now that I find you're out of my mind I can't believe that it's true<br />
<br>
I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before<br />
And it's wonderful now, I don't hurt anymore No use to deny, I wanted to die the day you said we were through<br />
But now that I find you're out of my mind I can't believe that it's true<br />
I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before<br />
And it's wonderful now, I don't hurt anymore</p>
