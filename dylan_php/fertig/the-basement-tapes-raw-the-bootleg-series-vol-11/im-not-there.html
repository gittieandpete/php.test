Thing's all right and she's all too tight<br />
In my neighborhood she cries both day and night<br />
I know it because I was there<br />
It's a milestone but she's down on her luck<br />
And she's daily salooning about to make her hard earned buck<br />
I was there I believe where she'd stop him if she wants time to care<br />
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care<br />
And I'd go by the Lord and when she's on my way<br />
But I don't belong there No, I don't belong to her, I don't belong to anybody<br />
She's my Christ forsaken angel but she don't hear me cry<br />
She's a lone hearted mystic and she can't carry on<br />
When I'm there she's alright but then she's not when I'm gone Heaven knows that the answer, she's don't calling no one<br />
She's the way, her sailing beauty for she's mine for the one<br />
And I lost her hesitating by temptation lest it runs<br />
But she don't holler me but I'm not there, I'm gone Now I'll cry tonight like I cried the night before<br />
And I'm released on the heights in but I'll dream about the door<br />
<br>
It's alone, she's forsaken by her fate, worse to tell<br />
"It don't have approximation", she smiled, "Fare thee well" Now when I?ll teach that lady I was born to love her<br />
But she knows that the kingdom waits so high above her<br />
And I run but I race but it's not too fast or slow<br />
But I don't perceive her, I'm not there, I'm gone Well, it's all about confusion and I cry for her<br />
Well, I don't need anybody now beside me to tell<br />
And it?s all affirmation I receive but it?s not<br />
She's adorned by the beauty but she don't like the spot and she won't Yes, she's gone like the rainbow that shined yesterday<br />
But now she's home beside me and I'd like her here to stay<br />
She's a lone forsaken beauty and it's don't trust anyone<br />
I wish I was beside her but I'm not there, I'm gone Well, it's too hard to stay here and I don't want to leave<br />
It?s so bad but amusing when she's hard, too hard to leave<br />
It?s a load, it?s a crime the way she haunt me around<br />
But she told, ?won't you hate me?? but [Incomprehensible] Yes, I believe that it?s rightful, oh, I believe it in my mind<br />
I been told like I said when I before carry on the grind<br />
And she's on yet she told her like I said, ?Carry on?<br />
I wish I was there to help her but I'm not there, I'm gone</p>
