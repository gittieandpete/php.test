Everybody's building<br />
The big ships and the boats<br />
Some are building monuments<br />
Others are jotting down notes Everybody's in despair<br />
Every girl and boy<br />
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here<br />
Everybody jump for joy Come all without, come all within<br />
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn Now I like to dude, just like the rest<br />
I left my sugar sweet<br />
But darning fumes and making haste<br />
It ain't my cup of meat Everybody's just standin' around 'neath the trees<br />
Feeding pigeons on a limb<br />
<br>
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here<br />
Then pigeons will go to him Come all without, come all within<br />
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn [Incomprehensible]<br />
I can recite 'em all<br />
Just tell me where it hurts<br />
And I'll tell you who to call Nobody can get in his sleep<br />
There's someone on everybody's toes<br />
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here<br />
Everybody's gonna doze Come all without, come all within<br />
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn<br />
Come all without, come all within<br />
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn</p>
