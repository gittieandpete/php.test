You know, there's two ol' maids layin' in the bed,<br />
One picked herself up an' the other one, she said:<br />
"Get your rocks off!<br />
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)" Well, you know, there late one night up on Blueberry Hill,<br />
One man turned to the other man and said, with a blood-curdlin' chill, he said:<br />
"Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
<br>
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)" Well, you know, we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek,<br />
One man said to the other man, he began to speak, he said:<br />
"Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)" Well, you know, we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus.<br />
All kinds-a children in the side road, they was hollerin' at us, sayin':<br />
"Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)<br />
Get your rocks off-a me!"</p>
