Santa-Fe,<br />
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe,<br />
My woman needs it ev'ryday,<br />
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,<br />
She's rollin' up a lotta bread<br />
To toss away.<br />
She's in Santa-Fe,<br />
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe<br />
Now she's opened up an old maid's home,<br />
She's proud, but she needs to roam,<br />
She's gonna write herself a roadside poem,<br />
About Santa-Fe.<br />
<br />
Santa-Fe,<br />
Dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.<br />
Since I'm never gonna cease to roam,<br />
I'm never, ever far from home,<br />
But I'll build a geodesic dome<br />
And sail away.<br />
<br>
Don't feel bad.<br />
No, no, no, no, don't feel bad<br />
It's the best food I've ever had.<br />
Makes me feel so glad<br />
That she's cooking in a home-made pad<br />
She never caught a cold so bad<br />
When I'm away.<br />
<br />
Santa-Fe,<br />
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.<br />
My shrimp boat's in the bay<br />
I won't have my nature this way,<br />
And I'm leanin' on the wheel each day<br />
To drift away<br />
From Santa-Fe,<br />
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.<br />
My sister looks good at home,<br />
She's lickin' on an ice cream cone,<br />
She's packin' her big white comb,<br />
What does it weigh?</p>
