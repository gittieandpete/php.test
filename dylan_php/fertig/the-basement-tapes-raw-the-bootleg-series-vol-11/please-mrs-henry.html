Well, I've already had two beers<br />
I'm ready for the broom<br />
Please, Missus Henry, won't you<br />
Take me to my room?<br />
I'm a good ol' boy<br />
But I've been sniffin' too many eggs<br />
Talkin' to too many people<br />
Drinkin' too many kegs<br />
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please<br />
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please<br />
I'm down on my knees<br />
An' I ain't got a dime<br />
Well, I'm groanin' in a hallway<br />
Pretty soon I'll be mad<br />
Please, Missus Henry, won't you<br />
Take me to your dad?<br />
I can drink like a fish<br />
I can crawl like a snake<br />
I can bite like a turkey<br />
I can slam like a drake<br />
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please<br />
Please, Missus Henry, missus Henry, please<br />
I'm down on my knees<br />
An' I ain't got a dime<br />
<br>
Now, don't crowd me, lady<br />
Or I'll fill up your shoe<br />
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy<br />
An' tonight I am blue<br />
I'm a thousand years old<br />
And I'm a generous bomb<br />
I'm t-boned and punctured<br />
But I'm known to be calm<br />
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please<br />
Please, missus henry, missus henry, please<br />
I'm down on my knees<br />
An' I ain't got a dime<br />
Now, I'm startin' to drain<br />
My stool's gonna squeak<br />
If I walk too much farther<br />
My crane's gonna leak<br />
Look, Missus Henry<br />
There's only so much I can do<br />
Why don't you look my way<br />
An' pump me a few?<br />
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please<br />
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please<br />
I'm down on my knees<br />
An' I ain't got a dime</p>
