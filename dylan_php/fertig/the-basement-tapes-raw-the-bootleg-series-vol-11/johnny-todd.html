Johnny Todd he took a notion<br />
For to sail the ocean wide.<br />
There he left his true love waiting<br />
Weeping on the Liverpool side.<br />
For a week she wept full sorely,<br />
Tore her hair and wrung her hands<br />
Till she met with another sailor<br />
Walking on the Liverpool sands.<br />
O fair maid why are you weeping<br />
For your Johnny gone to sea?<br />
If you'll wed with me tomorrow<br />
I will kind and constant be.<br />
<br>
I will buy you sheets and blankets,<br />
I'll buy you a wedding ring.<br />
You shall have a gilded cradle<br />
For to rock you baby in.<br />
Johnny Todd came home from sailing,<br />
Far across the ocean wide,<br />
There he found that his fair and false one<br />
Was another sailor's bride.<br />
So, all you lads who go a-sailing<br />
For to fight the foreign foe.<br />
Never leave your true love like Johnny,<br />
Marry her before you go!</p>
