Silent weekend,<br />
My baby she gave it to me<br />
Silent weekend,<br />
My baby she gave it to me.<br />
She's actin' tough and hardy<br />
She says it ain't my party<br />
And she's leavin' me in misery. Silent weekend,<br />
My baby she took me by surprise.<br />
Silent weekend,<br />
My baby she took me by surprise.<br />
She's rockin' and a-reelin'<br />
<br>
Head up to ceiling<br />
An' swinging with some other guys. Silent weekend,<br />
Oh Lord, I wish Monday would come.<br />
Silent weekend,<br />
Oh Lord, I sure wish Monday would come.<br />
She's uppity, she's rollin',<br />
She's in the groove, she's strolling<br />
Over to the jukebox playin' deaf and dumb. Well, I done a whole lotta thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of cheatin',<br />
And I, maybe I did some just to please.<br />
But I just walloped a lotta pizza after makin' our peace,<br />
Puts ya down on bended knees.</p>
