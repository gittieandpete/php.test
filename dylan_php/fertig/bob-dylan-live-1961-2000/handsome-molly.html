(first release, live version &quot;second gaslight tape&quot;, late 1962<br />
<br />
Well, i wish i was in london,<br />
Or some other seaport town<br />
I'd put my foot on a steamboat<br />
I'd sail the ocean 'round.<br />
<br />
While sailing 'round the ocean,<br />
While sailing 'round the sea<br />
I'd think of handsome molly<br />
Wherever she might be.<br />
<br />
Don't you remember, molly<br />
You gave me your right hand?<br />
You said whenever you'd marry<br />
I would be the man.<br />
<br />
But you broke your promise<br />
<br>
Go with whom you please<br />
My poor heart is aching<br />
You are at your ease.<br />
<br />
I went to church last sunday<br />
Molly came ridin' by<br />
I could tell her mind was changin'<br />
By the rovin' of her eye.<br />
<br />
I go down to the river<br />
Though everyone's asleep<br />
I think of handsome molly<br />
An' i begin to weep.<br />
<br />
So i wish i was in london,<br />
Or some other seaport town<br />
I'd put my foot on a steamboat<br />
I'd sail the ocean 'round.<br />
