Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,<br />
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,<br />
Never bein' able to separate the good from the bad,<br />
Ooh, i can't stand it, i can't stand it,<br />
It's makin' me feel so sad.<br />
<br />
Dead man, dead man,<br />
When will you arise?<br />
Cobwebs in your mind,<br />
Dust upon your eyes.<br />
<br />
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.<br />
Do you have any faith at all? do you have any love to share?<br />
The way that you hold your head, cursin' god with every move,<br />
Ooh, i can't stand it, i can't stand it,<br />
What are you tryin' to prove?<br />
<br />
Dead man, dead man,<br />
When will you arise?<br />
Cobwebs in your mind,<br />
Dust upon your eyes.<br />
<br />
<br>
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,<br />
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you end up in,<br />
The race of the engine that overrules your heart,<br />
Ooh, i can't stand it, i can't stand it,<br />
Pretending that you're so smart.<br />
<br />
Dead man, dead man,<br />
When will you arise?<br />
Cobwebs in your mind,<br />
Dust upon your eyes.<br />
<br />
What are you tryin' to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?<br />
My back is already to the wall, where can i run?<br />
The tuxedo that you're wearin', the flower in your lapel,<br />
Ooh, i can't stand it, i can't stand it,<br />
You wanna take me down to hell.<br />
<br />
Dead man, dead man,<br />
When will you arise?<br />
Cobwebs in your mind,<br />
Dust upon your eyes.<br />
