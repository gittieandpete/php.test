Ramona, come closer,<br />
Shut softly your watery eyes.<br />
The pangs of your sadness<br />
Shall pass as your senses will rise.<br />
The flowers of the city<br />
Though breathlike, get deathlike at times.<br />
And there's no use in tryin'<br />
T' deal with the dyin',<br />
Though i cannot explain that in lines.<br />
<br />
Your cracked country lips,<br />
I still wish to kiss,<br />
As to be under the strength of your skin.<br />
Your magnetic movements<br />
Still capture the minutes i'm in.<br />
But it grieves my heart, love,<br />
To see you tryin' to be a part of<br />
A world that just don't exist.<br />
It's all just a dream, babe,<br />
A vacuum, a scheme, babe,<br />
That sucks you into feelin' like this.<br />
<br />
I can see that your head<br />
Has been twisted and fed<br />
By worthless foam from the mouth.<br />
I can tell you are torn<br />
Between stayin' and returnin'<br />
On back to the south.<br />
You've been fooled into thinking<br />
<br>
That the finishin' end is at hand.<br />
Yet there's no one to beat you,<br />
No one t' defeat you,<br />
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.<br />
<br />
I've heard you say many times<br />
That you're better 'n no one<br />
And no one is better 'n you.<br />
If you really believe that,<br />
You know you got<br />
Nothing to win and nothing to lose.<br />
From fixtures and forces and friends,<br />
Your sorrow does stem,<br />
That hype you and type you,<br />
Making you feel<br />
That you must be exactly like them.<br />
<br />
I'd forever talk to you,<br />
But soon my words,<br />
They would turn into a meaningless ring.<br />
For deep in my heart<br />
I know there is no help i can bring.<br />
Everything passes,<br />
Everything changes,<br />
Just do what you think you should do.<br />
And someday maybe,<br />
Who knows, baby,<br />
I'll come and be cryin' to you.<br />
