(first release, live version, 2000, portsmouth, england)<br />
<br />
One two three four<br />
<br />
I'm a worried man, got a worried mind<br />
No one in front of me, no one behind<br />
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne.<br />
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes<br />
I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies<br />
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.<br />
Standin' on the gallows with my head in a noose<br />
Any minute now i'm expectin' all hell to break loose.<br />
People are crazy and times are strange<br />
I'm locked in tight, i'm outta range<br />
I used to care, but things have changed.<br />
<br />
This place ain't doing me any good<br />
I'm in the wrong town, i should be in hollywood<br />
Just for a second there i thought i saw something move<br />
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag<br />
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag<br />
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove.<br />
Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too<br />
Don't get up gentlemen, i'm only, i'm only passing through.<br />
People are crazy, times are strange<br />
I'm locked in tight, i'm out of range<br />
I used to care, but things have changed<br />
<br />
<br>
I've been walking forty miles of bad road<br />
If the bible is right, the world will explode<br />
I'm trying to get as far away from myself as i can.<br />
Things are too hot to touch<br />
The human mind can only stand so much<br />
You can't win with a losin' hand.<br />
Feel like fallin' in love with the first woman i meet<br />
Puttin' her in a wheel barrow, wheelin' her down the street.<br />
People are crazy, times are strange<br />
I'm locked in tight, i'm out of range<br />
I used to care, but things have changed.<br />
<br />
I hurt easy, i just don't show it<br />
You can hurt someone and not even know it<br />
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.<br />
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high<br />
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie<br />
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.<br />
Mr. jinx and miss lucy, they, they jumped in the lake<br />
I'm not that eager, not that eager to make a mistake.<br />
People are crazy, times are strange<br />
I'm locked in tight, i'm outta range<br />
I used to care, but things have changed.<br />
