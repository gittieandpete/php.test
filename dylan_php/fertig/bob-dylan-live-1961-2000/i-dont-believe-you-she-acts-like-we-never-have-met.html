I can't understand,<br />
She let go of my hand<br />
An' left me here facing the wall.<br />
I'd sure like t' know<br />
Why she did go,<br />
But i can't get close t' her at all.<br />
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime,<br />
She said she would never forget.<br />
But now mornin's clear,<br />
It's like i ain't here,<br />
She just acts like we never have met.<br />
<br />
It's all new t' me,<br />
Like some mystery,<br />
It could even be like a myth.<br />
Yet it's hard t' think on,<br />
That she's the same one<br />
That last night i was with.<br />
From darkness, dreams're deserted,<br />
Am i still dreamin' yet?<br />
I wish she'd unlock<br />
Her voice once an' talk,<br />
'stead of acting like we never have met.<br />
<br />
If she ain't feelin' well,<br />
Then why don't she tell<br />
'stead of turnin' her back t' my face?<br />
Without any doubt,<br />
She seems too far out<br />
<br>
For me t' return t' her chase.<br />
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling,<br />
I remember her whispering yet.<br />
But evidently she don't<br />
An' evidently she won't,<br />
She just acts like we never have met.<br />
<br />
If i didn't have t' guess,<br />
I'd gladly confess<br />
T' anything i might've tried.<br />
If i was with 'er too long<br />
Or have done something wrong,<br />
I wish she'd tell me what it is, i'll run an' hide.<br />
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played,<br />
Her mouth was watery and wet.<br />
But now something has changed<br />
For she ain't the same,<br />
She just acts like we never have met.<br />
<br />
I'm leavin' today,<br />
I'll be on my way<br />
Of this i can't say very much.<br />
But if you want me to,<br />
I can be just like you<br />
An' pretend that we never have touched.<br />
An' if anybody asks me, &quot;is it easy to forget?&quot;<br />
I'll say, &quot;it's easily done,<br />
You just pick anyone,<br />
An' pretend that you never have met!&quot;<br />
