(first release, live version, december 16, 1997, el ray theatre, los angeles)<br />
<br />
I'm beginnin' to hear voices and there's no one around<br />
Well i'm all used up and the fields have turned brown<br />
I went to church on sunday, she passed by<br />
Well my love for her has taken such a long time to die.<br />
Well, i'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist<br />
It's almost like, almost like i don't exist.<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town, cold irons bound.<br />
<br />
Well, the walls of pride, well they're high and they're wide<br />
Can't see over to the other side<br />
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay<br />
But it's sadder still to feel your heart turn away.<br />
One look at you and i'm out of control<br />
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town and cold irons bound.<br />
<br />
<br>
There's too many people, too many to recall<br />
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, i was wrong about 'em all<br />
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside mud<br />
Up over my head, nothing but clouds of blood.<br />
I found my world, found my world in you<br />
But your love just hasn't proved true.<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town and cold irons bound<br />
Twenty miles out of town and cold irons bound.<br />
<br />
Well the winds in chicago ah, they torn me to shreds<br />
Reality has always had too many heads<br />
I tried to love and protect you because i care<br />
I'm gonna remember forever the joy we've shared<br />
I'm looking at you and i'm on my bended knee<br />
You've no idea what you did to me<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town and cold irons bound<br />
Twenty miles out of town and cold irons bound.<br />
