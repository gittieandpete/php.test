Sometimes i feel so low-down and disgusted<br />
Can't help but wonder what's happenin' to my companions,<br />
Are they lost or are they found, have they counted the cost it'll take to bring<br />
Down<br />
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?<br />
There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.<br />
<br />
I had a woman down in alabama,<br />
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,<br />
She said, &quot;boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,<br />
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic.&quot;<br />
There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.<br />
<br />
All that foreign oil controlling american soil,<br />
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed.<br />
Sheiks walkin' around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose rings,<br />
Deciding america's future from amsterdam and to paris<br />
And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.<br />
<br />
Man's ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don't apply no more,<br />
You can't rely no more to be standin' around waitin'<br />
<br>
In the home of the brave, jefferson turnin' over in his grave,<br />
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate satan<br />
And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.<br />
<br />
Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters,<br />
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition<br />
But the enemy i see wears a cloak of decency,<br />
All non-believers and men stealers talkin' in the name of religion<br />
And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.<br />
<br />
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting<br />
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it.<br />
They say lose your inhibitions, follow your own ambitions,<br />
They talk about a life of brotherly love, show me someone who knows how to<br />
Live it. there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.<br />
<br />
Well, my baby went to illinois with some bad-talkin' boy she could destroy<br />
A real suicide case, but there was nothin' i could do to stop it,<br />
I don't care about economy, i don't care about astronomy<br />
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets,<br />
There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.<br />
