(first release, live version, february 1, 1998, new jersey center, new jersey)<br />
<br />
One, two, a-one two three<br />
<br />
In the lonely night<br />
In the shadows of a pale moonlight<br />
I think of you in black and white<br />
When we were made of dreams.<br />
I walk alone through the shakin' street,<br />
I'm a-listenin' to my heart beat<br />
In the record breaking heat<br />
Where we were born in time.<br />
<br />
Not one more night, not one more kiss,<br />
Not this time, i'll have no more of this.<br />
It's much too cruel, it's much too cool, way too revealing.<br />
You came, you saw, just like the law<br />
<br>
You married young, just like your ma,<br />
Oh babe, how you left me reelin' with this feelin'.<br />
Up on the rising curve<br />
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,<br />
I held you close and got what i deserve<br />
Where we were born in time.<br />
<br />
You pressed me once, pressed me twice,<br />
You hang the flame, but you'll pay the price.<br />
Oh babe, and that fire is still smokin'.<br />
You were snow, you were rain<br />
You were striped, lord and you were plain,<br />
Oh babe, truer words have never been spoken or broken.<br />
In the hills of mystery,<br />
In the foggy web of destiny,<br />
You can have what's left of me,<br />
Where we were born in time.<br />
