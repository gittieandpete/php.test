'twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood<br />
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud<br />
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
And if i pass this way again, you can rest assured<br />
I'll always do my best for her, on that i give my word<br />
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved<br />
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved.<br />
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,<br />
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail,<br />
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly i turned around and she was standin' there<br />
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair.<br />
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br>
Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost<br />
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed.<br />
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount<br />
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts<br />
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove<br />
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love.<br />
Do i understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes<br />
I bargained for salvation an' they gave me a lethal dose.<br />
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, i'm livin' in a foreign country but i'm bound to cross the line<br />
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday i'll make it mine.<br />
If i could only turn back the clock to when god and her were born.<br />
&quot;come in,&quot; she said,<br />
&quot;i'll give you shelter from the storm.&quot;<br />
