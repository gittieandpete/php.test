Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down<br />
But it looks like it don't.<br />
I'd like to get you to change your mind<br />
But it looks like you won't<br />
<br />
From now on I'll be busy.<br />
Ain't goin' nowhere fast.<br />
I'm just glad it's over<br />
I'm seeing the real you at last.<br />
<br />
Well, I risked my neck for you,<br />
Didn't I take chances?<br />
Didn't I rise above it all for you,<br />
The most unfortunate circumstances?<br />
<br />
Well, I have had some rotten nights,<br />
Didn't think that they would pass.<br />
I'm just thankful and grateful<br />
To be seeing the real you at last.<br />
<br />
I'm hungry and I'm irritable<br />
And I'm tired of this bag of tricks.<br />
At one time there was nothing wrong with me<br />
That you could not fix.<br />
<br />
<br>
Well, I sailed through the storm<br />
Strapped to the mast,<br />
But now the time has come<br />
And I'm seeing the real you at last.<br />
<br />
When I met you baby,<br />
You didn't show no visible scars.<br />
You could ride like Annie Oakley,<br />
You could shoot like Belle Starr.<br />
<br />
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble,<br />
Trouble always comes to pass,<br />
All I care about now<br />
Is that I'm seeing the real you at last.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby talk now,<br />
I guess I should have known.<br />
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles,<br />
I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.<br />
<br />
Whatever you gonna do,<br />
Please do it fast.<br />
I'm still trying to get used to<br />
Seeing the real you at last.<br />
