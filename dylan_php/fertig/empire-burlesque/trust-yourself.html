Trust yourself,<br />
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best<br />
Trust yourself<br />
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed<br />
Don't trust me to show you beauty<br />
When beauty may only turn to rust<br />
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.<br />
<br />
Trust yourself<br />
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end<br />
Trust yourself<br />
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when<br />
Don't trust me to show you the truth<br />
When the truth may only be ashes and dust<br />
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, you're on your own, you always were<br />
In a land of wolves and thieves<br />
Don't put your hope in ungodly man<br />
Or be a slave to what somebody else believes.<br />
<br />
Trust yourself<br />
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down<br />
Trust yourself<br />
And look not for answers where no answers can be found<br />
Don't trust me to show you love<br />
When my love may be only lust<br />
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.<br />
<br />
You, you got to trust yourself ....</p>
