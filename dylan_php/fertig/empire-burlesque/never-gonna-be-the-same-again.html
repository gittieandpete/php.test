Now you're here beside me, baby<br />
You're a living dream<br />
And every time you get this close<br />
It makes me want to scream<br />
You touched me and you knew<br />
That I was warm for you and then<br />
I ain't never gonna be the same again.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I hurt you, baby<br />
Sorry if I did<br />
Sorry if I touched the place<br />
Where your secrets are hid<br />
But you meant more than everything<br />
And I could not pretend<br />
I ain't never gonna be the same again.<br />
<br />
You give me something to think about, baby<br />
Every time I see ya<br />
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving<br />
<br>
I'd just like it to be my idea.<br />
<br />
You taught me how to love you, baby<br />
You taught me, oh, so well<br />
Now, I can't go back to what was, baby<br />
I can't unring the bell<br />
You took my reality<br />
And cast it to the wind<br />
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.<br />
<br />
Come on, baby<br />
Come on, darlin'<br />
You're too hot, darlin'<br />
Come on, baby<br />
Come on, honey<br />
You're my baby<br />
You're my honey<br />
You got it baby<br />
Come on, baby.</p>
