Well, I had to move fast<br />
And I couldn't with you around my neck<br />
I said I'd send for you and I did<br />
What did you expect ?<br />
My hands are sweating<br />
And we haven't even started yet<br />
I'll go along with the charade<br />
Until I can think my way out<br />
I know it was all a big joke<br />
Whatever it was all about<br />
Someday maybe<br />
I'll remember to forget.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna get my coat<br />
I feel the breath of a storm<br />
There's something I've got to do tonight<br />
You go inside and stay warm.<br />
<br />
Has anybody seen my love<br />
Has anybody seen my love<br />
Has anybody seen my love<br />
I don't know<br />
Has anybody seen my love ?<br />
<br />
You want to talk to me<br />
Go ahead and talk<br />
Whatever you got to say to me<br />
Won't come as any shock<br />
I must be guilty of something<br />
You just whisper it into my ear<br />
Madame Butterfly<br />
She lulled me to sleep<br />
In a town without pity<br />
Where the water runs deep<br />
<br>
She said, "Be easy, baby<br />
There aint nothing worth stealing in here".<br />
<br />
You're the one I've been looking for<br />
You're the one that's got the key<br />
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you<br />
Or, or you're too good for me. Has anybody seen my love<br />
Has anybody seen my love<br />
Has anybody seen my love<br />
I don't know<br />
Has anybody seen my love ?<br />
<br />
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight<br />
And there's no moon<br />
There's just a hot-blooded singer<br />
Singing 'Memphis in June'<br />
And they're beating the devil out of a guy<br />
Who's wearing a powder-blue wig<br />
Later he'll be shot<br />
For resisting arrest<br />
I can still hear his voice crying<br />
In the wilderness<br />
What looks large from a distance<br />
Close up ain't never that big.<br />
<br />
I never could learn to drink that blood<br />
And call it wine<br />
I never could learn to hold you, love<br />
And call you mine.<br />
<br />
Has anybody seen my love<br />
Has anybody seen my love<br />
Has anybody seen my love<br />
I don't know<br />
Has anybody seen my love ?</p>
