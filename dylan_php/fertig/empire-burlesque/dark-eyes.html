Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside<br />
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide<br />
I live in another world where life and death are memorized<br />
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.<br />
<br />
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer<br />
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere<br />
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise<br />
Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.<br />
<br>
<br />
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes<br />
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is<br />
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized<br />
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.<br />
<br />
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel<br />
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling gods of speed and steel<br />
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies<br />
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.</p>
