Something is burning, baby, are you aware ?<br />
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair<br />
Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign<br />
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind ?<br />
<br />
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while<br />
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file<br />
What's your position, baby, what's going on ?<br />
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone ?<br />
<br />
I know everything about this place, or so it seems<br />
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams ?<br />
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed<br />
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange ?<br />
<br />
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say<br />
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today<br />
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue<br />
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you ?<br />
<br />
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins<br />
Where the charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins<br />
<br>
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light ?<br />
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night ?<br />
<br />
I can feel it, in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you<br />
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true<br />
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied<br />
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.<br />
<br />
Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain ?<br />
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train<br />
Answer me, baby, a casual look will do<br />
Just what in the world has come over you ?<br />
<br />
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down<br />
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town<br />
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve<br />
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.<br />
<br />
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames<br />
There's a man going 'round calling names<br />
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you<br />
I'm believe in the impossible, you know that I do.</p>
