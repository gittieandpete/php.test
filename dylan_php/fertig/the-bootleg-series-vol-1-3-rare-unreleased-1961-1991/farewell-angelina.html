[Verse 1]<br />
<br />
Farewell Angelina<br />
The bells of the crown<br />
Are being stolen by bandits<br />
I must follow the sound<br />
The triangle tingles<br />
The music play slow<br />
But farewell Angelina<br />
The night is on fire<br />
And I must go<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
There is no use in talking<br />
And there's no need for blame<br />
There is nothing to prove<br />
Ev'rything still is the same<br />
A table stands empty<br />
By the edge of the stream<br />
But farewell Angelina<br />
The sky's changing colours<br />
And I must leave<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
The jacks and the queens<br />
They forsake the courtyard<br />
Fifty-two gypsies<br />
Now file past the guards<br />
In the space where the deuce<br />
And the ace once ran wild<br />
Farewell Angelina<br />
The sky is folding<br />
I'll see you after a while<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting<br />
Perched in the sun<br />
Shooting tin cans<br />
With a sawed-off shotgun<br />
<br>
And the corporals and neighbors<br />
Clap and cheer with each blast<br />
Farewell Angelina<br />
The sky it is trembling<br />
And I must leave fast<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
King Kong, little elves<br />
In the rooftoops they dance<br />
Valentino-type tangos<br />
While the hero's clean hands<br />
Shut the eyes of the dead<br />
Not to embarrass anyone<br />
Farewell Angelina<br />
The sky is flooding over<br />
And I must be gone<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
The camouflaged parrot<br />
He flutters from fear<br />
When something he doesn't know about<br />
Suddenly appears<br />
What cannot be imitated<br />
Perfect must die<br />
Farewell Angelina<br />
The sky's flooding over<br />
And I must go where it is dry<br />
<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
Machine guns are roaring<br />
Puppets heave rocks<br />
At misunderstood visions<br />
And at the faces of clocks<br />
Call me any name you like<br />
I will never deny it<br />
But farewell Angelina<br />
The sky is erupting<br />
And I must go where it's quiet</p>
