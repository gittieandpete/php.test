[Verse 1]<br />
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents<br />
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents<br />
See my hound dog bite a rabbit<br />
And my football's sitting on a barbed-wire fence<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet don't walk so fast<br />
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet don't walk so fast<br />
Well, this Arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot<br />
But wouldn't tell me if what I had would last<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
<br>
Well, this woman I've got, she's filling me with her drive<br />
Yes, this woman I've got, she's thrilling me with her hive<br />
She's calling me Stan<br />
Or else she calls me Mister Clive<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff<br />
I know you're gonna think this song is a cliff<br />
Unless you've been inside a tunnel<br />
And fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence<br />
<br />
[Outro]<br />
All night!</p>
