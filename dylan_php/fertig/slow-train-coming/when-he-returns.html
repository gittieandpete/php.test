The iron hand it ain't no match for the iron rod<br />
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God<br />
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears<br />
It is only He who can reduce me to tears<br />
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn<br />
Like a thief in the night, he'll replace wrong with right<br />
When he returns.<br />
<br />
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that is passes through<br />
He unreleased His power at an unknown hour that no one knew<br />
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice ?<br />
<br>
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness ?<br />
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride ?<br />
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease<br />
Until He returns ?<br />
<br />
Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask<br />
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask<br />
How long can you falsily and deny what is real ?<br />
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal ?<br />
Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned<br />
He's got plans of his own to set up His throne<br />
When He return.</p>
