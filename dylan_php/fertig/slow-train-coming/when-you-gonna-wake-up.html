God don't make promises that He don't keep<br />
You got some big dreams baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.<br />
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up strengthen the things that remain ?<br />
<br />
Counterfeited philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts<br />
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, Henry Kissinger's got you tied up in knots.<br />
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up strengthen the things that remain ?<br />
<br />
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled<br />
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never cure your ills.<br />
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up strengthen the things that remain ?<br />
<br />
You got men who can't hold their peace and woman who can't control their tongues<br />
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.<br />
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up strengthen the things that remain ?<br />
<br />
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools<br />
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.<br />
<br>
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up strengthen the things that remain ?<br />
<br />
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move<br />
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved.<br />
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up strengthen the things that remain ?<br />
<br />
Do you ever wonder just what God requires ?<br />
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires.<br />
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain ?<br />
<br />
You can't take it with you and you know that it's too worthless to be sold<br />
They tell you, 'Time is money' as if your life was worth its weight in gold.<br />
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain ?<br />
<br />
There's a man up on a cross and He's been crucified for you<br />
Believe in His power that's about all you got to do.<br />
<br />
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up <br />
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain ?</p>
