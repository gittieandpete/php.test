Precious angel, under the sun<br />
How was I to know you'd be the one<br />
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone<br />
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon ?<br />
<br />
Now there's spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down<br />
Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain't neutral ground<br />
The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived<br />
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe ?<br />
<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself<br />
I'm a little too blind to see.<br />
<br />
My so called friends have fallen under a spell<br />
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well all is well'"<br />
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high<br />
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die.<br />
<br />
Sister, lemme tell you about a vision that I saw<br />
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law<br />
<br>
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed in the same breath<br />
You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal's death.<br />
<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself<br />
I'm a little too blind to see.<br />
<br />
Precious angel, you believe me when I say<br />
What God has given to us no man can take away<br />
We are covered in blood girl, you know our forefathers were slaves<br />
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.<br />
<br />
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight<br />
You're the lamb of my soul, girl, and you touch up the night <br />
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed<br />
On the way out of Egypt, through Etopoia, to the judgement hall of Christ.<br />
<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Shine you light, shine your light on me<br />
Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself<br />
I'm a little too blind to see.</p>
