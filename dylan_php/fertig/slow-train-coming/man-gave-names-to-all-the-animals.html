Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, in the beginning<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, long time ago. <br />
<br />
He saw an animal that liked to growl<br />
Big furry paws and he liked to howl<br />
Great big furry back and furry hair<br />
"Ah, think I'll call it a bear".<br />
<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, in the beginning<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, long time ago. <br />
<br />
He saw an animal up on a hill<br />
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled<br />
He saw milk coming out but he didn't know how<br />
"Ah, think I'll call it a cow".<br />
<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, in the beginning<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, long time ago. <br />
<br />
He saw an animal that liked to snort<br />
Horns on his head and they weren't too short<br />
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull<br />
<br>
"Ah, I'll think I'll call it a bull".<br />
<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, in the beginning<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, long time ago. <br />
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail<br />
Real dirty face and a curly trail<br />
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big<br />
"Ah, think I'll call it a pig".<br />
<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, in the beginning<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, long time ago. <br />
<br />
Next animal that he did meet<br />
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet<br />
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep<br />
"Ah, think I'll call it a sheep".<br />
<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, in the beginning<br />
Man gave names to all the animals<br />
In the beginning, long time ago. <br />
<br />
He saw an animal as smooth as glass<br />
Slithering his way through the grass<br />
Saw him dissappear by a tree near a lake .....</p>
