You may be an ambassador to England or France<br />
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance<br />
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world<br />
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls.<br />

You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride<br />
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side<br />
