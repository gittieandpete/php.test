They ask me how I feel <br />
And if my love is real <br />
And how I know I'll make it through <br />
And they, they look at me and frown <br />
They'd like to drive me from this town <br />
They don't want me around <br />
'Cause I believe in you <br />
<br />
They show me to the door <br />
They say don't come back no more <br />
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to <br />
And I walk out on my own <br />
A thousand miles from home <br />
But I don't feel alone <br />
'Cause I believe in you <br />
<br />
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter <br />
I believe in you even though we be apart <br />
I believe in you even on the morning after <br />
Oh, when the dawn is nearing <br />
Oh, when the night is disappearing <br />
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart <br />
<br>
<br />
Don't let me drift too far <br />
Keep me where you are <br />
Where I will always be renewed <br />
And that which you've given me today <br />
Is worth more than I could pay <br />
And no matter what they say <br />
I believe in you <br />
<br />
I believe in you when winter turn to summer <br />
I believe in you when white turn to black <br />
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered <br />
Oh, though the earth may shake me <br />
Oh, though my friends forsake me <br />
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back <br />
<br />
Don't let me change my heart <br />
Keep me set apart <br />
From all the plans they do pursue <br />
And I, I don't mind the pain <br />
Don't mind the driving rain <br />
I know I will sustain <br />
'Cause I believe in you</p>
