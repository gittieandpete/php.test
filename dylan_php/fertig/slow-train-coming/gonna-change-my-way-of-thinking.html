Gonna change my way of thinking<br />
Make myself a different set of rules<br />
Gonna change my way of thinking<br />
Make myself a different set of rules<br />
Gonna put my good foot forward<br />
And stop being influenced by fools.<br />
<br />
So much oppression<br />
Can't keep track of it no more<br />
So much oppression<br />
Can't keep track of it no more<br />
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers<br />
And old men turning young daughters into whores.<br />
<br />
Stripes on your shoulders<br />
Stripes on your back and on your hands<br />
Stripes on your shoulders<br />
Stripes on your back and on your hands<br />
Swords piercing your side<br />
Blood and water flowing through the land.<br />
<br />
Well don't know which one is worse<br />
Doing your own thing or just being cool<br />
Well don't know which one is worse<br />
Doing your own thing or just being cool<br />
You remember only about the brass ring<br />
You forget all about the golden rule.<br />
<br>
<br />
You can mislead a man<br />
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes<br />
You can mislead a man<br />
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes<br />
But there's only one authority<br />
And that's the authority on high.<br />
<br />
I got a God-fearing woman<br />
One I can easily afford<br />
I got a God-fearing woman<br />
One I can easily afford<br />
She can do the Georgia crawl<br />
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord. <br />
<br />
Jesus said, "Be ready<br />
For you know not the hour in which I come"<br />
Jesus said, "Be ready<br />
For you know not the hour in which I come"<br />
He said, "He who is not for Me is against Me"<br />
Just so you know where He's coming from.<br />
<br />
There's a kingdom called Heaven<br />
A place where there is no pain of birth<br />
There's a kingdom called Heaven<br />
A place where there is no pain of birth<br />
Well the Lord created it, mister<br />
About the same time He made the earth.</p>
