Seven days, seven more days she'll be comin'<br />
I'll be waiting at the station for her to arrive<br />
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive.<br />
<br />
She been gone ever since I been a child<br />
Ever since I seen her smile, I ain't forgotten her eyes.<br />
She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies.<br />
<br />
I been good, I been good while I been waitin'<br />
Maybe guilty of hesitatin', I just been holdin' on<br />
Seven more days, all that'll be gone.<br />
<br />
There's kissing in the valley,<br />
Thieving in the alley,<br />
<br>
Fighting every inch of the way.<br />
Trying to be tender<br />
With somebody I remember<br />
In a night that's always brighter'n the day.<br />
<br />
Seven days, seven more days that are connected<br />
Just like I expected, she'll be comin' on forth,<br />
My beautiful comrade from the north.<br />
<br />
There's kissing in the valley,<br />
Thieving in the alley,<br />
Fighting every inch of the way.<br />
Trying to be tender<br />
With somebody I remember<br />
In a night that's always brighter'n the day.</p>
