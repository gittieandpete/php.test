Love that's pure hopes all things<br />
Believes all things, won't pull no strings<br />
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome<br />
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.<br />
<br />
You don't want a love that's pure<br />
You wanna drown love<br />
You want a watered-down love.<br />
<br />
Love that's pure, it don't make no claims<br />
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame<br />
Will not deceive you or lead you to transgression<br />
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.<br />
<br />
You don't want a love that's pure<br />
You wanna drown love<br />
You want a watered-down love.<br />
<br>
<br />
Love that's pure won't lead you astray<br />
Won't hold you back, won't mess up your day<br />
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes<br />
It don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious.<br />
<br />
You don't want a love that's pure<br />
You wanna drown love<br />
You want a watered-down love.<br />
<br />
Love that's pure ain't no accident<br />
Always on time, is always content<br />
An eternal flame, quietly burning<br />
Never needs to be proud, nor restlessly yearning.<br />
<br />
You don't want a love that's pure<br />
You wanna drown love<br />
You want a watered-down love.</p>
