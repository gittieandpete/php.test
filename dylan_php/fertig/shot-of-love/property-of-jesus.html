Go ahead and talk about him because he makes you doubt<br />
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without<br />
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do<br />
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.<br />
<br />
He's the property of Jesus<br />
Resent him to the bone<br />
You got something better<br />
You've got a heart of stone.<br />
<br />
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street<br />
Hope he falls upon himself, oh, won't that be sweet<br />
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore<br />
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.<br />
<br />
He's the property of Jesus<br />
Resent him to the bone<br />
You got something better<br />
You've got a heart of stone.<br />
<br />
When the whip that's keeping you in line doesn't make him jump<br />
Say he's hard-of-hearing, say that he's a chump<br />
Say he's out of step with reality as you try to test his nerve<br />
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.<br />
<br>
<br />
He's the property of Jesus<br />
Resent him to the bone<br />
You got something better<br />
You've got a heart of stone.<br />
<br />
Say that he's a looser 'cause he got no common sense<br />
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense<br />
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style <br />
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes or fairy tales, say things that make you smile.<br />
<br />
He's the property of Jesus<br />
Resent him to the bone<br />
You got something better<br />
You've got a heart of stone.<br />
You can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games<br />
You think that when you rest at last you'll go back from where you came<br />
But you're picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb<br />
What happened to the real you, you've been captured but by whom ?<br />
<br />
He's the property of Jesus<br />
Resent him to the bone<br />
You got something better<br />
You've got a heart of stone.</p>
