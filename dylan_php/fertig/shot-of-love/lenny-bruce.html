Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lived on and on<br />
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon<br />
He was an outlaw, that's for sure<br />
More of an outlaw than you ever were<br />
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit's living on and on.<br />
<br />
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out<br />
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about<br />
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babie's heads<br />
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds<br />
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.<br />
<br>
<br />
Lenny bruce is dead but he didn't commit any crime<br />
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time<br />
I rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half<br />
Seemed like it took a couple of months<br />
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone.<br />
<br />
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules<br />
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools<br />
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts<br />
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts<br />
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.</p>
