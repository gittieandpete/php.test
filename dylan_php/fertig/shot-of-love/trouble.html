Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm <br />
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm <br />
But they can't help you none when there's trouble <br />
<br />
Trouble <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
Nothin' but trouble <br />
<br />
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air <br />
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there <br />
Revolution even ain't no solution for trouble <br />
<br />
Trouble <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
Nothin' but trouble <br />
<br />
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul <br />
Persecution, execution, governments out of control <br />
You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble <br />
<br>
<br />
Trouble <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
Nothin' but trouble <br />
<br />
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground <br />
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around? <br />
Since the beginning of the universe man's been cursed by trouble <br />
<br />
Trouble <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
Nothin' but trouble <br />
<br />
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned <br />
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed <br />
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble <br />
<br />
Trouble <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
Nothin' but trouble</p>
