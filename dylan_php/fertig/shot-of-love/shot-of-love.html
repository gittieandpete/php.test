I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.<br />
<br />
Don't need a shot of parish to kill my disease<br />
Don't need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees<br />
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent<br />
Don't need a shot of whiskey, help me be president.<br />
<br />
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.<br />
<br />
Doctor, can you hear me ? I need some Medicaid<br />
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid<br />
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead<br />
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon his head.<br />
<br />
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.<br />
<br />
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you<br />
I've heard all of them rumors you have heard them too<br />
Don't show me no picture show or give me no book to read<br />
It don't satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds.<br />
<br />
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.<br />
<br>
<br />
Why would I want to take your life<br />
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife<br />
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen<br />
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.<br />
<br />
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.<br />
<br />
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight<br />
Veronica is not here, Mavis just ain't right<br />
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth and near<br />
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here ?<br />
<br />
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.<br />
<br />
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight ?<br />
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right<br />
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away<br />
My conscience is beginning to bother me today.<br />
<br />
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.<br />
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.<br />
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.</p>
