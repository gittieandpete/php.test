Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement<br />
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent<br />
Felt around for the light switch, became nauseated<br />
She was walking down the hallway while the walls deteriorated.<br />
<br />
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar<br />
I see the burning of the page<br />
Curtain rising on a new age<br />
See the groom still waiting at the altar.<br />
<br />
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery<br />
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your shyness for snobbery<br />
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me<br />
About the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.<br />
<br />
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar<br />
I see the burning of the stage<br />
Curtain rising on a new age<br />
See the groom still waiting at the altar.<br />
<br />
Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt me<br />
Finally had to give her up about the time she began to want me<br />
But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated<br />
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she didn't make me feel so obligated.<br />
<br>
<br />
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar<br />
I see the burning of the cage<br />
Curtain rising on a new age<br />
See the groom still waiting at the altar.<br />
<br />
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature ?<br />
I see people who are supposed to know better standing around like furniture<br />
There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it<br />
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.<br />
<br />
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar<br />
I see the burning of the stage<br />
Curtain rising on a new age<br />
See the groom still waiting at the altar.<br />
Cities on fire, phones out of order<br />
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border<br />
What can I say about Claudette ? Ain't seen her since January<br />
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.<br />
<br />
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar<br />
I see the burning of the cage<br />
Curtain rising on a new age<br />
See the groom still waiting at the altar.</p>
