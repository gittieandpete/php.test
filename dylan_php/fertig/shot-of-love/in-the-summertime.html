I was in your presence for an hour or so<br />
Or was it a day ? I truly don't know<br />
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low<br />
By that soft and shining sea<br />
Did you respect me for what I did<br />
Or for what I didn't do, or for keeping it hid ?<br />
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid<br />
Of everything you see ?<br />
<br />
In the summertime, ah in the summertime<br />
In the summertime, when you were with me.<br />
<br />
I got the heart and you got the blood<br />
We cut through iron and we cut through mud<br />
Then came the warning that was before the flood<br />
That set everybody free<br />
Fools they made a mock of sin<br />
<br>
Our loyalty they tried to win<br />
But you were closer to me than my next af kin<br />
When they didn't want to know or see.<br />
<br />
In the summertime, ah in the summertime<br />
In the summertime, when you were with me.<br />
<br />
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs<br />
Poverty and shame was theirs<br />
But all that suffering was not to be compared<br />
With the glory that is to be<br />
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave<br />
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved<br />
It'll be with me unto the grave<br />
And then unto eternity.<br />
<br />
In the summertime, ah in the summertime<br />
In the summertime, when you were with me.</p>
