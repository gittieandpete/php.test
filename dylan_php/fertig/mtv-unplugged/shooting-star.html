Seen a shooting star tonight<br />
And I thought of you<br />
You were trying to break into another world<br />
A world I never knew<br />
I always kind of wondered<br />
If you ever made it through<br />
Seen a shooting star tonight<br />
And I thought of you<br />
<br />
Seen a shooting star tonight<br />
And I thought of me<br />
If I was still the same<br />
If I ever became what you wanted me to be<br />
Did I miss the mark or over-step the line<br />
That only you could see?<br />
Seen a shooting star tonight<br />
<br>
And I thought of me<br />
<br />
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell<br />
As the last fire truck from hell<br />
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying,<br />
It's the last temptation<br />
The last account<br />
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount<br />
The last radio is playing<br />
<br />
Seen a shooting star tonight<br />
Slip away<br />
Tomorrow will be another day<br />
Guess it's too late to say the things to you<br />
That you needed to hear me say<br />
Seen a shooting star tonight<br />
Slip away</p>
