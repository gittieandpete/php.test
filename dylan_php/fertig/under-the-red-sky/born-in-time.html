In the lonely night in the blinking stardust of a pale blue light<br />
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams<br />
You're blowin' down a shaky street you're hearing my heart beat<br />
In the record breaking heat where we were born in time.<br />
<br />
Not one more night not one more kiss<br />
Not this time babe no more of this<br />
Takes too much skill takes too much of will<br />
It's too reavealing.<br />
<br />
You came you saw just like the law<br />
You married young just like you ma<br />
You tried and tried you made me slide<br />
You left me reeling with this feeling<br />
<br>
<br />
On the rising curve where the ways of nature will test every nerve<br />
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.<br />
<br />
You pressed me once you pressed me twice<br />
You hung the blade you'll pay the price<br />
Oh babe that fire is still smoking.<br />
<br />
You were snow you were rain<br />
You were striped you were plain<br />
Oh babe truer words have not been spoken<br />
Or broken.<br />
<br />
If there's a mystery in the foggy world of destiny<br />
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.</p>
