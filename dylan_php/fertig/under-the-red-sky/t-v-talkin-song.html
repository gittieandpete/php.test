One time in london i'd gone out for a walk,<br />
Past a place called hyde park where people talk<br />
'bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view<br />
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.<br />
<br />
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks<br />
About the t.v. god and all the pain that it invokes.<br />
&quot;it's too bright a light&quot;, he said, &quot;for anybody's eyes,<br />
If you've never seen one it's a blessing in disguise.&quot;<br />
<br />
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,<br />
Two men in front of me were coming to blows<br />
The man was saying something 'bout children when they're young<br />
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.<br />
<br />
&quot;the news of the day is on all the time,<br />
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme,<br />
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,<br />
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br>
&quot;pray for peace!&quot;. he said, you could feel it in the crowd.<br />
My thoughts began to wander. his voice was ringing loud,<br />
&quot;it will destroy your family, your happy home is gone<br />
No one can protect you fro it once you turn it on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;it will led you into some strange pursuits,<br />
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.<br />
It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about,<br />
Sometimes you gotta do like elvis did and shoot the damn thing out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;it's all been designed&quot;, he said, &quot;to make you lose your mind,<br />
And when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.&quot;<br />
&quot;everytime you look at it, your situation's worse,<br />
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,<br />
There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran.<br />
The t.v. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me,<br />
Later on that evening, i watched it on t.v..<br />
