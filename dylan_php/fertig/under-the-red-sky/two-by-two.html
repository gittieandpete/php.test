One by one they followed the sun<br />
One by one until there where none<br />
Two by two to their lovers they flew<br />
Two by two into the foggy dew.<br />
<br />
Three by three they danced on the sea<br />
Four by four they danced on the shore<br />
Five by five they tried to survive<br />
Six by six they were playing with tricks.<br />
<br />
How many paths did he try and fail<br />
How many of their brothers and sisters linger in jail<br />
How much poison did their inhale<br />
How many black cats crossed their trail.<br />
<br />
Seven by seven they head for heaven<br />
Eight by eight their got to the gate<br />
Nine by nine they drank the wine<br />
<br>
Ten by ten they drank it again.<br />
<br />
How many tomorrows have they given away<br />
How many compared to yesterday<br />
How many more without any reward<br />
How many more can they afford.<br />
<br />
Two by two they step into the ark<br />
Two by two they step in the dark<br />
Three by three they're turning the key<br />
Four by four they turn it some more.<br />
<br />
One by one they followed the sun<br />
Two by two to another rendezvous<br />
Three by three don't tread on me<br />
Four by four they're loosing the war.<br />
<br />
Five by five can't stay alive ......</p>
