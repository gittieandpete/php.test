Handy Dandy controversy surrounds him<br />
He's been around the world and back again<br />
Something in the moonlight still hounds him.<br />
<br />
Handy Dandy just like sugar and candy<br />
Handy Dandy if every bone in his body were a-broken he would never admit it<br />
He got an all girl orchestra and when he says strike up the band they hit it.<br />
<br />
Handy Dandy<br />
Handy Dandy<br />
He'll say what are you made off<br />
He'll say can you repeat what you say<br />
You'll say what are you afraid off<br />
He'll say nothing neither alive nor dead.<br />
<br />
Handy Dandy he's got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money<br />
He'll say oh darling tell me the truth how much time I got<br />
She'll say you got all the time in the world honey.<br />
<br />
<br>
Handy Dandy<br />
Handy Dandy<br />
He got that clear crystal fountain<br />
He got that soft silky skin<br />
He got that fortress on the mountain<br />
With no doors or windows so no thieves can break in.<br />
<br />
Handy Dandy sitting with a girl named Nancy and I got feeling kinda lazy<br />
He said Hon' if you want a gun I'll give you one<br />
She said boy you're talking crazy.<br />
<br />
Handy Dandy just like sugar and candy<br />
Handy Dandy pour him another brandy<br />
Handy Dandy he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow<br />
He finishes his drink he gets up from the table he says<br />
OK boys I'll see you tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Handy Dandy<br />
Handy Dandy just like sugar and candy<br />
Handy Dandy just like sugar and candy.</p>
