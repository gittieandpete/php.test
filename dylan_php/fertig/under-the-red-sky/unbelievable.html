It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,<br />
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.<br />
You go north and you go south<br />
Just like bait in the fish's mouth.<br />
Ya must be livin' in the shadow of some kind of evil star.<br />
It's unbelievable it would get this far.<br />
<br />
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,<br />
It's indescribable it can drive you to drink.<br />
They said it was the land of milk and honey,<br />
now they say it's the land of money.<br />
Who ever thought they could ever make that stick.<br />
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.<br />
<br />
Every head is so dignified, every moon is so sanctified,<br />
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.<br />
All the silver, all the gold, all the sweethearts you can hold<br />
That don't come back with stories untold, are hanging on a tree.<br />
<br />
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,<br />
<br>
It's so impossible to even learn the tune.<br />
Kill that beast and feed that swine,<br />
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,<br />
Feed that horse and saddle up the drum.<br />
It's unbelievable, the day would finally come.<br />
<br />
Once there was a man who had no eyes,<br />
Every lady in the land told him lies,<br />
He stood beneath the silver skies<br />
And his heart began to bleed.<br />
Every brain is civilized,<br />
Every nerve is analyzed,<br />
Everything is criticized when you are in need.<br />
<br />
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,<br />
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.<br />
Turn your back, wash your hands,<br />
There's always someone who understands<br />
It don't matter no more what you got to say<br />
It's unbelievable it would go down this way.</p>
