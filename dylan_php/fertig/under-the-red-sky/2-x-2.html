<br />
One by one, they followed the sun,<br />
One by one, until there were none.<br />
Two by two, to their lovers they flew,<br />
Two by two, into the foggy dew.<br />
Three by three, they danced on the sea,<br />
Four by four, they danced on the shore,<br />
Five by five, they tried to survive,<br />
Six by six, they were playing with tricks.<br />
<br />
Bridge #1:<br />
How many paths did they try and fail?<br />
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?<br />
How much poison did they inhale?<br />
How many black cats crossed their trail?<br />
<br />
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven,<br />
<br>
Eight by eight, they got to the gate,<br />
Nine by nine, they drank the wine,<br />
Ten by ten, they drank again.<br />
<br />
Bridge #2:<br />
How many tomorrow's have are they given away?<br />
How many compared to yesterday?<br />
How many more without any reward?<br />
How many more can they afford?<br />
<br />
Two by two, they stepped into the ark,<br />
Two by two, they step in the dark.<br />
Three by three, they're turning the key,<br />
Four by four, they turn it some more,<br />
One by one, they follow the sun,<br />
Two by two, to another rendezvous.<br />
