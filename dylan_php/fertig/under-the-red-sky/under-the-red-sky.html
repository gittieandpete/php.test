There was a little boy<br />
And there was a little girl<br />
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.<br />
<br />
There was a little boy<br />
And there was a little girl<br />
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.<br />
<br />
There was an old man <br />
And he lived in the moon<br />
One summer's day he came passing by.<br />
<br />
There was an old man <br />
And he lived in the moon<br />
And one day he came passing by.<br />
<br />
Some day little girl<br />
Everything for you is gonna be new<br />
Some day little girl<br />
You'll have a diamond as big as your shoe.<br />
<br>
<br />
Let the wind blow low<br />
Let the wind blow high<br />
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie.<br />
<br />
Let the wind blow low<br />
Let the wind blow high<br />
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie.<br />
<br />
This is the key to the kingdom<br />
And this is the town<br />
This is the blind horse<br />
That leads you around.<br />
<br />
Let the bird sing<br />
Let the bird fly<br />
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry.<br />
<br />
Let the bird sing<br />
Let the bird fly<br />
The man in the moon went home and the river went dry.</p>
