One time in London I gone out for a walk<br />
Past the place called Hyde Park where people talk<br />
About all kinds of different gods they have their point of view<br />
To anyone passing by and it's who they're talking to.<br />
<br />
There was someone on the platform talking to the folks<br />
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes<br />
It's too bright a light he said for anybody's eyes<br />
If you've never seen one it's bleesing in disguise.<br />
<br />
I moved in closer got up on my toes<br />
Two men in front of me were coming to blows<br />
A man was saying something about children when they're young<br />
Being sacrificed that's why lullabies are being sung.<br />
<br />
The news of the day is on all the time<br />
All the latest gossip all the latest rhyme<br />
You mind is you temple keep it beautiful and free<br />
Don't let an egg get laid in there by something you can't see.<br />
<br>
<br />
Pray for people he said you could feel it in the crowd<br />
My thoughts began to wander but his voice was ringing loud<br />
It will destroy you family your happy home is gone<br />
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on.<br />
<br />
It will lead you in to some strange pursuits<br />
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits<br />
Scramble up your head and drag your brain about<br />
Sometimes you got to do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out.<br />
<br />
It's all been designed he said to make you loose your mind<br />
And when you go back to find it there's nothing there to find<br />
Every time you look at it your situations worse<br />
If you feel it grabbing out for you send for the nurse.<br />
<br />
The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man<br />
There was pushing there was showing and everybody ran<br />
The TV crew was there to film it they jumped right over me<br />
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.</p>
