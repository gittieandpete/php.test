Ten thousand men on a hill,<br />
Ten thousand men on a hill,<br />
Some of 'm goin' down, some of 'm gonna get killed.<br />
<br />
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,<br />
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,<br />
Drummin' in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.<br />
<br />
Ten thousand men on the move,<br />
Ten thousand men on the move,<br />
None of them doing nothin' that your mama wouldn't disapprove.<br />
<br />
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,<br />
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,<br />
All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold.<br />
<br />
Hey! Who could your lover be?<br />
<br>
Hey! Who could your lover be?<br />
Let me eat off his head so you can really see!<br />
<br />
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,<br />
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,<br />
Standin' at my window wishing me goodnight.<br />
<br />
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,<br />
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,<br />
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.<br />
<br />
Ten thousand women all sweepin' my room,<br />
Ten thousand women all sweepin' my room,<br />
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.<br />
<br />
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!<br />
Baby, thank you for my tea!<br />
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.</p>
