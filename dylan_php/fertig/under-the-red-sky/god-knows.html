God knows you ain't pretty,<br />
God knows it's true.<br />
God knows there ain't anybody<br />
Ever gonna take the place of you.<br />
<br />
God knows it's a struggle,<br />
God knows it's a crime,<br />
God knows there's gonna be no more water<br />
But fire next time.<br />
<br />
[Bridge #1:]<br />
God didn't call it treason,<br />
God didn't call it wrong,<br />
It was supposed to last a season<br />
But it's been so strong for so long.<br />
<br />
God knows it's fragile,<br />
God knows everything,<br />
God knows it could snap apart right now<br />
Just like putting scissors to a string.<br />
<br />
[Bridge #2:]<br />
God knows it's terrifying,<br />
<br>
God sees it all unfold,<br />
There's a million reasons for you to be crying<br />
You been so bold and so cold.<br />
<br />
God knows that when you see it,<br />
God knows you've got to weep,<br />
God knows the secrets of your heart,<br />
He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.<br />
<br />
God knows there's a river,<br />
God knows how to make it flow,<br />
God knows you ain't gonna be taking<br />
Nothing with you when you go.<br />
<br />
God knows there's a purpose,<br />
God knows there's a chance,<br />
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour<br />
Of any circumstance.<br />
<br />
God knows there's a heaven,<br />
God knows it's out of sight,<br />
God knows we can get all the way from here to there<br />
Even if we've got to walk a million miles by candlelight.</p>
