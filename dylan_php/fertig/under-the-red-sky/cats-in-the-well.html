The cat's in the well the wolf is looking down<br />
The cat's in the well the wolf is looking down<br />
He got a big bushy tail dragging all over the ground.<br />
<br />
The cat's in the well the gentle lady is asleep<br />
Cat's in the well gentle lady is asleep<br />
She ain't hearing things silence is-a-stickin' her deep.<br />
<br />
Cat's in the well and grief is showing it's face<br />
The world's been slaughtered it's such a bloody disgrace.<br />
<br />
The cat's in the well horses going bumpety bump<br />
The cat's in the well horses going bumpety bump<br />
But God is silent doing the American jump.<br />
<br>
<br />
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news<br />
His hair's falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.<br />
<br />
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull<br />
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull<br />
Tonight is so long and the table is oh so full.<br />
<br />
The cat's in the well and the servant's at the door<br />
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.<br />
<br />
The cat's in the well and leaves are starting to fall<br />
The cat's in the well and leaves are starting to fall<br />
Goodnight my love may lord have mercy on us all.</p>
