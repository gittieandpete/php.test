Three angels up above the street<br />
Each one playing a horn <br />
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out<br />
They're been there since Christmas morn'<br />
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash<br />
Then a lady in a bright orange dress<br />
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels<br />
The Tenth Avenue bus going west<br />
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around<br />
A man with a badge skips by<br />
<br>
Three fellows crawling on their way back to work<br />
Nobody stops to ask why<br />
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence<br />
Where the angels stand high on their poles<br />
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face<br />
In this concrete world full of souls<br />
The angels play on their horns all day<br />
The whole earth in progressions seems to pass by<br />
But does anyone hear the music they play ?<br />
Does anyone even try ?</p>
