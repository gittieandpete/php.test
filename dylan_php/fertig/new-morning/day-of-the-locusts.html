Oh the benches were stained with tears and perspiration<br />
The birdies were flying from tree to tree<br />
There was little to say, there was no conversation<br />
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree<br />
And the locusts sang off in the distance<br />
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody<br />
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance<br />
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.<br />
<br />
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking<br />
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb<br />
I was ready to leave, I was already walkin'<br />
But the next time I looked there was light in the room<br />
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill<br />
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody<br />
Oh, the locusts sang their high whinning trill<br />
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.<br />
<br />
<br>
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin'<br />
The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees<br />
The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding<br />
Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me<br />
Yeah,the locusts sang off in the distance<br />
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody<br />
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance<br />
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.<br />
<br />
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma<br />
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive<br />
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota<br />
Sure was glad to get out of there alive<br />
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill<br />
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody<br />
And the locusts sang with a high whinning trill<br />
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me<br />
Singing for me, well, singing for me.</p>
