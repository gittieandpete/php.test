If dogs run free, then why not we <br />
Across the swooping plain ?<br />
My ears hear a symphony <br />
Of two mules, trains and rain<br />
The best is always yet to come <br />
That's what they explain to me<br />
Just do your thing, you'll be king <br />
If dogs run free.<br />
<br />
If dogs run free, why not me<br />
Across the swamp of time ?<br />
My mind weaves a symphony <br />
And tapestry of rhyme<br />
<br>
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee <br />
So it may flow and be<br />
To each his own, it's all unknown <br />
If dogs run free.<br />
<br />
If dogs run free, then what must be <br />
Must be and that is all<br />
True love can make a blade of grass<br />
Stand up straight and tall <br />
In harmony with the cosmic sea <br />
True love needs no company<br />
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole<br />
If dogs run free.</p>
