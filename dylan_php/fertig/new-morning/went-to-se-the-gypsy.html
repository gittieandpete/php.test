Went to see the gypsy<br />
Staying in a big hotel<br />
He smiled when he saw me coming <br />
And he said, "Well, well, well"<br />
His room was dark and crowded<br />
Lights were low and dim<br />
"How are you" he said to me<br />
I said it back to him.<br />
<br />
I went down to the lobby<br />
To make a small call out<br />
A pretty dancing girl was there <br />
And she began to shout<br />
"Go on back to see the gypsy <br />
He can move you from the rear<br />
Drive you from your fear <br />
<br>
Bring you through the mirror<br />
He did it in Las Vegas <br />
And he can do it here".<br />
<br />
Outside the lights were shining <br />
On the river of tears<br />
I watched them from the distance <br />
With the music in my ears.<br />
<br />
I went back to see the gypsy <br />
It was nearly early dawn<br />
The gypsy's door was open wide <br />
But the gypsy was gone<br />
And that pretty dancing girl <br />
She could not be found<br />
So I watched that sun come rising <br />
From that little Minnesota town.</p>
