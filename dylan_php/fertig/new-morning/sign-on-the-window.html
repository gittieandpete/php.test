Sign on the window says, "Lonely"<br />
Sign on the door said, "No company allowed"<br />
Sign on the street says, "You don't own me"<br />
Sign on a porch says, "Three's a crowd"<br />
Sign on a porch says that three's a crowd.<br />
<br />
Her and her boyfriend went to California<br />
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune<br />
My best friend said, "Now didn't I warn you ?<br />
Brightoon girls are like the moon<br />
<br>
Brightoon girls are like the moon".<br />
<br />
Looks like a-nothing but rain<br />
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street<br />
Hope that it don't sleet.<br />
<br />
Built me a cabin in Utah<br />
Marry me a wife, catch a rainbow trout<br />
Have a bunch of kids who call me pa<br />
That must be what it's all about<br />
That must be what it's all about.</p>
