Slippin' and slidin' like a weasel on the run<br />
I'm lookin' good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun<br />
One more weekend, one more weekend with you<br />
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do<br />
<br />
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck<br />
We'll fly over the ocean just like you suspect<br />
One more weekend, one more weekend with you<br />
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do<br />
<br />
We'll fly the night away<br />
<br>
Hang out the whole next day<br />
Things will be okay<br />
You wait and see<br />
We'll go someplace unknown<br />
Leave all the children home<br />
Honey, why not go alone<br />
Just you and me<br />
<br />
Comin' and goin' like a rabbit in the wood<br />
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, lookin' so good<br />
One more weekend, one more weekend with you<br />
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do (yes, you will)</p>
