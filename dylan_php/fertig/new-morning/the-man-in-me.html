The man in me will do nearly any task<br />
As for compensation, there's a little he will ask<br />
Take a woman like you <br />
To get through to the man in me.<br />
<br />
Storm clouds are raging all around my door<br />
I think to myself I might not take it anymore<br />
Take a woman like your kind <br />
To find the man in me.<br />
<br>
<br />
But, oh what a wonderful feeling<br />
Just to know that you are near<br />
It sets my heart a-reeling<br />
From my toes up to my ears.<br />
<br />
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen<br />
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine<br />
Take a woman like you <br />
To get through to the man in me.</p>
