Can't you hear that rooster crowing ?<br />
Rabbit running down across the road<br />
Underneath the bridge where the water flows through <br />
So happy just to see you smile <br />
Underneath the sky of blue<br />
On this new morning, new morning<br />
On this new morning with you.<br />
<br />
Can't you hear that motor turning<br />
Automobile coming into style<br />
Coming down the road for a country mile or two ?<br />
So happy just to see you smile <br />
Underneath the sky of blue<br />
On this new morning, new morning <br />
On this new morning with you.<br />
<br />
<br>
The night passed away so quickly <br />
It always does when you're with me.<br />
<br />
Can't you feel that sun a-shinning ? <br />
Ground hog running by the country stream<br />
This must be the day when all of my dreams come true<br />
So happy just to be alive <br />
Underneath the sky of blue<br />
On this new morning, new morning <br />
On this new morning with you.<br />
<br />
So happy just to be alive <br />
Underneath the sky of blue<br />
On this new morning, new morning<br />
On this new morning with you<br />
New morning ...</p>
