I went to see The Gypsy <br />
Staying in a big hotel <br />
He smiled when he saw me comin' an' he said: "well, well, well" <br />
His room was dark and crowded <br />
lights were low and dim <br />
"How are you"? he said to me <br />
I said it back to him <br />
<br />
I went down to the lobby <br />
To make a small call out <br />
A pretty dancing girl was there and she began to shout <br />
Go on back to see The Gypsy <br />
He can move you from the rear <br />
Drive you from your fear <br />
<br>
Bring you through the mirror <br />
He did it in Las Vegas <br />
An' he can do it here <br />
<br />
Outside the lights were shining <br />
On the river of tears <br />
I watched him from the distance with the music in my ears <br />
I went back to see The Gypsy <br />
It was nearly early dawn <br />
The Gypsy's door was open wide but The Gypsy was gone <br />
And that pretty dancing girl <br />
She could not be found <br />
So I watched that sun come rising from a little Minnesota town <br />
From that little Minnesota town</p>
