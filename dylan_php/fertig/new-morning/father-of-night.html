Father of night, Father of day<br />
Father who takes the darkness away<br />
Father who teacheth the birds to fly<br />
Builder of rainbows up in the sky<br />
Father of loneliness and pain<br />
Father of love and Father of rain.<br />
<br />
Father of day, Father of night<br />
Father of black, Father of white<br />
Father who built the mountains so high<br />
<br>
Who shapeth the cloud there up in the sky<br />
Father of time and Father of dreams<br />
Father who turneth the river and stream.<br />
<br />
Father of grain, Father of wheat<br />
Father of cold and Father of heat<br />
Father of air and Father of trees<br />
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories<br />
Father of minutes, Father of days<br />
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.</p>
