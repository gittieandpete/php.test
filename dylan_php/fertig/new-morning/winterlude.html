Winterlude, Winterlude, oh darling<br />
Winterlude by the road tonight<br />
Tonight there will be no quarreling<br />
Everything is gonna be all right<br />
Oh I see by the angel beside me <br />
That love has a reason to shine<br />
You're the one I adore come over here and give me more<br />
Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.<br />
<br />
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple<br />
Winterlude by the corn in the field<br />
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel<br />
Then come back and cook up a meal<br />
<br>
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens<br />
By the sun near the old crossroad sign<br />
The snow is so cold but our love can be bold<br />
Winterlude, don't be rude please be mine.<br />
<br />
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy<br />
Winterlude by the telephone wire<br />
Winterlude, it's making me lazy<br />
Come one, sit by the logs in the fire<br />
The moonlight reflects from the window<br />
Where the snowflakes they cover the sand<br />
Come out tonight everything will be tight<br />
Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.</p>
