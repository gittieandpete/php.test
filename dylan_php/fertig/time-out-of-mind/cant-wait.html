I can't wait<br />
Wait for you to change your mind<br />
It's late<br />
I'm tryin' to walk the line<br />
<br />
Well, it's way past midnight<br />
And there's some people all around<br />
Some on their way up<br />
Some on their way down<br />
<br />
The air burns and I'm tryin to think straight<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
I'm your man<br />
I've tried to recover the sweet love that we knew<br />
<br />
You understand<br />
That my heart can't go on beating without you<br />
Well your loveliness has wounded me<br />
I'm reeling from the blow<br />
<br />
I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so<br />
I'm breathin' hard standin' at the gate<br />
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
Skies are gray<br />
<br />
<br>
I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow<br />
Night or day<br />
It doesn't matter where I go anymore I just go<br />
If I ever saw you comin' I don't know what I might do<br />
<br />
I'd like to think I could control myself<br />
But it isn't true<br />
That's how it is<br />
When things disintegrate<br />
<br />
And I don't know how much longer I can wait<br />
I'm doomed to love you<br />
I been rollin' through stormy weather<br />
I'm thinkin' of you<br />
<br />
And all the places we could roam together<br />
It's mighty funny<br />
The end of time has just begun<br />
Oh honey, after all these years you're still the one<br />
<br />
Well I'm strollin' through the lonely graveyard of my mind<br />
I left my life with you<br />
Somewhere back there along the line<br />
I thought somehow that I would be spared this day<br />
<br />
I don't know how much longer I can wait</p>
