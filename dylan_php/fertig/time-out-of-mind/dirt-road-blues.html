Gonna walk down that dirt road<br />
'Til someone lets me ride<br />
Gonna walk down that dirt road<br />
'Til someone lets me ride<br />
If I can't find my baby<br />
I'm gonna run away and hide.<br />
<br />
Well, I've been pacin' 'round the room<br />
Hopin' maybe she'd come back<br />
Pacin' 'round the room<br />
Hopin' maybe she'd come back<br />
Well, I've been praying for salvation<br />
Layin' 'round in a one-room country shack.<br />
<br />
Gonna walk down that dirt road<br />
Until my eyes begin to bleed<br />
<br>
Gonna walk down that dirt road<br />
Until my eyes begin to bleed<br />
'Til there's nothing left to see<br />
'Til the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.<br />
<br />
But I've been at my shadow<br />
I been watchin' the colors up above<br />
Lookin' at my shadow<br />
Watchin' the colors up above<br />
Rolling through the rain and hail<br />
Lookin' for the sunny side of love.<br />
<br />
Gonna walk on that dirt road<br />
'Til everything becomes the same<br />
Gonna walk down that dirt road<br />
'Til everything becomes the same<br />
I'll keep on walkin' 'til I hear her holler at my name.</p>
