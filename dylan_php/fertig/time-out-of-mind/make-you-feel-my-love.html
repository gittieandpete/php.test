When the rain is blowing in your face<br />
And the whole world is on your case<br />
I could offer a warm embrace<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
<br />
When evening shadows and the stars appear<br />
And there is no one there to dry your tears<br />
I could hold you for a million years<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
<br />
I know you haven't made your mind up yet<br />
But I would never do you wrong<br />
I've known it from the moment that we met<br />
No doubt in my mind where you belong<br />
<br>
<br />
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue<br />
I'd go crawling down the avenue<br />
And oh, there's nothing that I wouldn't do<br />
To make you feel my love<br />
<br />
The storms are raging on the rolling sea<br />
And on the highway of regret<br />
The winds of change are blowing wild and free<br />
You ain't seen nothing like me yet<br />
<br />
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true<br />
Nothing that I wouldn't do<br />
Go to the ends of the earth for you<br />
To make you feel my love</p>
