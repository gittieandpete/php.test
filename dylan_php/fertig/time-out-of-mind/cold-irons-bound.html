I'm beginnin' to hear voices and there's no one around<br />
I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown<br />
I went to church on Sunday as she passed by<br />
And my love for her has taken such a long time to die<br />
Well, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist<br />
It's almost like, almost like, I don't exist<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town, Cold Irons bound.<br />
<br />
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide<br />
Can't see over to the other side<br />
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay<br />
It's sadder still to feel your heart turn away<br />
One look at you and I'm out of control<br />
Like the universe has swallowed me whole<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.<br />
<br />
There's too many people, too many to recall<br />
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all<br />
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside mud<br />
Up over my head, nothing but clouds of blood<br />
<br>
I found my world, found my world in you<br />
But your love just hasn't proved true<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound<br />
Twenty miles out of town, Cold Irons bound.<br />
<br />
Well the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds<br />
Reality has always had too many heads<br />
Some things last longer than you think they will<br />
Some kind of things you can never kill<br />
Though it's you, and you only, I'm singin' about<br />
But you can't see in and it's hard looking out<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.<br />
<br />
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank<br />
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank<br />
I tried to love and protect you because I care<br />
I'm gonna remember forever the joy we've shared<br />
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee<br />
You've no idea what you did to me<br />
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound<br />
Twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.</p>
