I'm walking through streets that are dead <br />
Walking, walking with you in my head <br />
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired <br />
And the clouds are weeping <br />
<br />
Did I hear someone tell a lie? <br />
Did I hear someone's distant cry? <br />
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile <br />
While I was sleeping <br />
<br />
I'm sick of love <br />
But I'm in the thick of it <br />
This kind of love <br />
I'm so sick of it <br />
<br />
I see, I see lovers in the meadow <br />
I see, I see silhouettes in the window <br />
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on <br />
To a shadow <br />
<br>
<br />
I'm sick of love <br />
I hear the clock tick <br />
This kind of love <br />
I'm love sick <br />
<br />
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder <br />
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder <br />
Could you ever be true? I think of you <br />
And I wonder <br />
<br />
I'm sick of love <br />
I wish I'd never met you <br />
I'm sick of love <br />
I'm trying to forget you <br />
<br />
Just don't know what to do <br />
I'd give anything to <br />
Be with you</p>
