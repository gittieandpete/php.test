Well, my heart's in the highlands, gentle and fair<br />
Honey suckle bloomin' in the wildwood air<br />
Bluebells blazin' where the Aberdeen waters flow<br />
Well, my heart's in the highlands, I'm gonna go there when<br />
I feel good enough to go.<br />
<br />
Windows were shakin' all night in my dreams<br />
Everything was exactly the way that it seems<br />
Woke up this mornin' and I looked at the same old page<br />
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.<br />
<br />
I don't want nothin' from anyone, ain't that much to take<br />
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake<br />
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery<br />
I wish someone would come and push back the clock for me.<br />
<br />
Well, my heart's in the highlands, wherever I roam<br />
That's where I'll be when I get called home<br />
The wind it whispers to the buck-eyed trees of rhyme<br />
Well, my heart's in the highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.<br />
<br />
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound<br />
Someone's always yellin', "Turn him down"<br />
Feel like I'm driftin', driftin' from scene to scene<br />
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.<br />
<br />
Insanity is smashin' up against my soul<br />
You could say I was on anything but a roll<br />
If I had a conscience, well I just might blow my top<br />
What would I do with it anyway, maybe take it to the pawn shop.<br />
<br />
My heart's in the highlands at the break of dawn<br />
By the beautiful lake of the black swan<br />
Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low<br />
Well, my heart's in the highlands, only place left to go.<br />
<br />
I'm in Boston town, in some restaurant<br />
I got no idea what I want<br />
Or maybe I do but, I'm just really not sure<br />
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.<br />
<br />
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around<br />
She studies me closely as I sit down<br />
She got a pretty face, with long white shiny legs<br />
I said, "Tell me what I want," she say, "You probably want hard boiled eggs."<br />
<br />
I say, "That's right, bring me some."<br />
She says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."<br />
Then she says, "I know you're an artist, draw a picture of me."<br />
I said, "I would if I could but I don't do sketches from memory."<br />
<br />
Well, she then, she says, "I'm right here in front of you, or<br />
<br>
haven't you looked?"<br />
I say, "All right, I know but I don't have my drawing book."<br />
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."<br />
I say, "Yes I could but I don't know where my pencil is at."<br />
<br />
She pulls one out from behind her ear<br />
She says, "All right now go ahead, draw me, I'm stayin' right here."<br />
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see<br />
Well, she takes her napkin and throws it back and says, "That<br />
don't look a thing like me."<br />
<br />
I said, "Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does."<br />
She say, "You must be jokin'," I say, "I wish I was."<br />
Then she says, "You don't read women authors do ya?" at least<br />
that's what I think I hear her say<br />
Well, I said, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"<br />
<br />
Well she says, "You just don't seem like you do." I said,<br />
"You're way wrong."<br />
She says "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read<br />
Erica Jong."<br />
She goes away for a minute and I slide out, out of my chair<br />
I step outside back to the busy street but nobody is goin' anywhere.<br />
<br />
Well, my heart's in the highlands with the horses and hounds<br />
Way up in the border country far from the towns<br />
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow<br />
My heart's in the highlands, I can't see any other way to go.<br />
<br />
Every day is the same thing, out the door<br />
Feel further away than ever before<br />
Some things in life it just gets too late to learn<br />
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must have made a few bad turns.<br />
<br />
I see people in the park forgettin' their troubles and woes<br />
They're drinkin' and dancin', wearin' bright colored clothes<br />
All the young men, with the young women lookin' so good<br />
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute, if I could.<br />
<br />
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog<br />
Talkin' to myself in a monologue<br />
I think what I need might be a full length leather coat<br />
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.<br />
<br />
The sun is beginnin' to shine on me<br />
But it's not like the sun that used to be<br />
The party's over and there's less and less to say<br />
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.<br />
<br />
Well, my heart's in the highlands at the break of day<br />
Over the hills and far away<br />
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow<br />
Well, I'm already there in my mind, and that's good enough for now.</p>
