I'm a-walkin' through the summer nights<br />
The jukebox playing low<br />
Yesterday everything was goin' too fast<br />
Today it's moving too slow.<br />
<br />
I got no place left to turn<br />
I got nothing left to burn<br />
Don't know if I saw you<br />
If I would kiss you or kill you<br />
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow<br />
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'<br />
I got nothing to go back to now.<br />
<br />
The light in this place is so bad<br />
Makin' me sick in the head<br />
All the laughter is just makin' me sad<br />
The stars have turned cherry red.<br />
<br />
I'm strummin' on my gay guitar<br />
Smokin' a cheap cigar<br />
The ghost of our old love has not gone away<br />
Don't look it like it will any time soon<br />
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'<br />
Under the midnight moon.<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll get me, and maybe they won't<br />
But not tonight and it won't be here<br />
There are things I could say but I don't<br />
I know the mercy of God must be near.<br />
<br />
I've been ridin' the midnight train<br />
Got ice water in my vein.<br />
<br>
<br />
I would be crazy if I took you back<br />
It would go up against every rule<br />
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'<br />
Sufferin' like a fool.<br />
<br />
When the last rays of daylight go down<br />
Buddy you're older or more<br />
I can hear the church bells ringin' in the yard<br />
I wonder who they're ringin' for?<br />
<br />
I know I can't win<br />
But my heart just won't give in.<br />
<br />
Last night I danced with a stranger<br />
But she just reminded me you were the one.<br />
<br />
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'<br />
In the dark land of the sun.<br />
<br />
I'll eat when I'm hungry<br />
Drink when I'm dry<br />
And live my life on the square<br />
And even if the flesh falls off of my face<br />
I know someone will be there to care.<br />
<br />
It always meaned so much, even the softest touch.<br />
<br />
I see nothin' to be gained by any explanation<br />
There's no words that need to be said<br />
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'<br />
Blues wrapped around my head.</p>
