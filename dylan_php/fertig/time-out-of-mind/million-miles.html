You took a part of me that I really miss<br />
I keep askin' myself how long it can go on like this<br />
You told yourself a lie - that's alright, mama, I told myself one too<br />
I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.<br />
<br />
You took the silver, you took the gold<br />
You left me standin' out in the cold<br />
People ask about you, I didn't tell them everything I knew<br />
Well, I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.<br />
<br />
I'm driftin' in and out of dreamless sleep<br />
Throwin' all my memories in a ditch so deep<br />
Did so many things I never did intend to do<br />
Well, I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.<br />
<br />
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low<br />
I need every bit of it for the places that I go<br />
Sometimes I wonder 'til it's just what it's all coming to<br />
Well, I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink<br />
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think<br />
Feel like talkin' to somebody but I just don't know who<br />
Well, I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.<br />
<br />
Yes, the last thing you said before ya hit the street<br />
Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet<br />
I said, "That's all right, mamma, you, you do what you gotta do"<br />
Well, I've tried to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.<br />
<br />
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once<br />
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months<br />
And I'll rock you too<br />
I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.<br />
<br />
Well, there's voices in the night tryin' to be heard<br />
I'm sittin' here listening to every mind-pollutin' word<br />
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two<br />
Yes, I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.</p>
