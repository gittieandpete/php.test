Shadows are fallin' and I've been here all day<br />
It's too hot to sleep and time is runnin' away<br />
Feel like my soul has turned into steel<br />
I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal<br />
There's not even room enough to be anywhere<br />
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.<br />
<br />
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain<br />
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain<br />
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind<br />
She put down in writin' what was in her mind<br />
I just don't see why I should even care<br />
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.<br />
<br>
<br />
Well, I've been to London and I been to gay Paris<br />
I've followed the river and I got to the sea<br />
I've been down on the bottom of the world full of lies<br />
I ain't lookin' for nothin' in anyone's eyes<br />
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear<br />
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.<br />
<br />
I was born here and I'll die here against my will<br />
I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still<br />
Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb<br />
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from<br />
Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer<br />
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there.</p>
