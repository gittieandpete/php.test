Well my nerves are exploding and my body's tense<br />
I feel like the whole world gonna end up against the fence<br />
I've been hit too hard, seen too much<br />
Nothing can heal me now but your touch<br />
I just don't know what I'm gonna do<br />
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you.<br />
<br />
Well, my house is on fire, burnin' to the sky<br />
Well, I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by<br />
And I feel like I'm comin' to the end of my way<br />
I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray<br />
Still, I don't know what I'm gonna do<br />
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you.<br />
<br />
Boys in the street beginnin' to play<br />
Girls like birds, flyin' away<br />
When I'm gone you will remember my name<br />
<br>
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame<br />
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do<br />
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you.<br />
<br />
Well, junk's pilin' up, takin' up space<br />
My eyes feel like they've fallen off my face<br />
Sweat pourin' down, I'm starin' at the floor<br />
I'm thinkin' about that girl who won't be back no more<br />
I just don't know what to do<br />
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm tired of talkin', I'm tired of tryin' to explain<br />
My attemps to please ya, they were all in vain<br />
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down<br />
If I'm still among the livin' I'll be Dixie bound<br />
Still, I just don't know what I'm gonna do<br />
I was all right, 'til I fell in love with you.</p>
