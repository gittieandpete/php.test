The air is getting hotter <br />
There's a rumbling in the skies <br />
I've been wading through the high muddy water <br />
With the heat rising in my eyes <br />
<br />
Every day your memory grows dimmer <br />
It doesn't haunt me like it did before <br />
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere <br />
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door <br />
<br />
When I was in Missouri <br />
They would not let me be <br />
I had to leave there in a hurry <br />
I only saw what they let me see <br />
<br />
You broke a heart that loved you <br />
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore <br />
I've been walking that lonesome valley <br />
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door <br />
<br />
People on the platforms <br />
Waiting for the trains <br />
I can hear their hearts a-beatin' <br />
Like pendulums swinging on chains <br />
<br>
 <br />
When you think that you've lost everything <br />
You find out you can always lose a little more <br />
I'm just going down the road feeling bad <br />
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door <br />
<br />
I'm going down the river <br />
Down to New Orleans <br />
They tell me everything is gonna be all right <br />
But I don't know what "all right" even means <br />
<br />
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane <br />
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore <br />
I been all around the world, boys <br />
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door <br />
<br />
Gotta sleep down in the parlor <br />
And relive my dreams <br />
I'll close my eyes and I wonder <br />
If everything is as hollow as it seems <br />
<br />
Some trains don't pull no gamblers <br />
No midnight ramblers, like they did before <br />
I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down <br />
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door</p>
