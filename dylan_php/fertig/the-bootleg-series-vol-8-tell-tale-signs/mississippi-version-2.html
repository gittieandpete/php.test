Every step of the way, we walk the line<br />
Your days are numbered, so are mine<br />
Time is piling up, we struggle and we stray<br />
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape<br />
<br />
City's just a jungle, more games to play<br />
Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away<br />
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town<br />
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down<br />
<br />
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before<br />
Don't even have anything for myself anymore<br />
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down<br />
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around<br />
<br />
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime<br />
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme<br />
Only one thing I did wrong<br />
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long<br />
<br />
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall<br />
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all<br />
I was thinking about the things that Rosie said<br />
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed<br />
<br />
Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees<br />
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees<br />
So many things that we never will undo<br />
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too<br />
<br>
<br />
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't<br />
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't<br />
I need something strong to distract my mind<br />
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind<br />
<br />
Well I got here following the southern star<br />
I crossed that river just to be where you are<br />
Only one thing I did wrong<br />
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long<br />
<br />
Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast<br />
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past<br />
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free<br />
I've got nothing but affection for all those who sailed with me<br />
<br />
Everybody's moving, if they ain't already there<br />
Everybody got to move somewhere<br />
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow<br />
Things should start to get interesting right about now<br />
<br />
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin<br />
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in<br />
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind<br />
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine<br />
<br />
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay<br />
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way<br />
Only one thing I did wrong<br />
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long</p>
