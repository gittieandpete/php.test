[Chorus]<br />
When I send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none<br />
If she gets unruly, thinks she don't want you<br />
If she gets unruly and thinks she don't want you<br />
Take my 32-20 now and break her half in two<br />
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light<br />
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light<br />
I got a 32-30, makes the camp all right<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none<br />
Gonna shoot my pistol, shoot my Gatling gun<br />
Gonna shoot my pistol, got to shoot my Gatling gun<br />
<br>
You made me love you, now your man has come<br />
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?<br />
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?<br />
You got your hair all tangled and you ain't talking right<br />
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well<br />
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well<br />
I got a 32-20 now it's a burning hell<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come<br />
All the doctors in, sure ain't gonna help her none<br />
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?<br />
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?<br />
Didn't come home till the sun was shining bright<br />
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest<br />
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest<br />
With this 32-20 laying up and down my breast</p>
