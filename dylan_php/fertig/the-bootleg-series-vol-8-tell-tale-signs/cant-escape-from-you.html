Oh the evening train is rolling<br />
All along the homeward way<br />
All my hopes are over the horizon<br />
All my dreams have gone away<br />
The hillside darkly shaded<br />
Stars fall from above<br />
All the joys of Earth have faded<br />
The night's untouched, my love<br />
I'll be here 'til tomorrow<br />
Beneath a shroud of gray<br />
I pretend I'm free of sorrow<br />
My heart is miles away<br />
The dead bells are ringing<br />
My train is overdue<br />
To your memory I'm clinging<br />
I can't escape from you<br />
<br />
Well I hear the sound of thunder<br />
Roaring loud and long<br />
Sometimes you've got to wonder<br />
God knows I've done no wrong<br />
You've wasted all your power<br />
You threw out the Christmas pie<br />
Now you're withering like a flower<br />
You'll play the fool and die<br />
I'm neither sad nor sorry<br />
I'm all dressed up in black<br />
I fought for fame and glory<br />
You tried to break my back<br />
In the far off sweet forever<br />
The sunshine peeking through<br />
We should have walked together<br />
I can't escape from you<br />
<br>
<br />
I cannot grasp the shadows<br />
That gather near the door<br />
Rain falls round my window<br />
I wish I'd seen you more<br />
The path is ever winding<br />
The stars they never age<br />
The morning light is blinding<br />
All the world's a stage<br />
Should be the time of gladness<br />
Happy faces everywhere<br />
The mystery of madness<br />
Is propagating in the air<br />
I don't like the city<br />
Not like some folks do<br />
Isn't it a pity<br />
I can't escape from you<br />
<br />
We plowed the fields of heaven<br />
Right down to the end<br />
I hope I can be forgiven<br />
If any words of mine offend<br />
All our days were splendid<br />
They were simple, they were plain<br />
It never should have ended<br />
I should have kissed you in the rain<br />
I've been thinking things all over<br />
All the moments full of grace<br />
The primrose and the clover<br />
Your ever changing face<br />
Can't help looking at you<br />
You made love with god-knows-who<br />
Never found a gal to match you<br />
I can't escape from you</p>
