Well I'm sitting in church<br />
In an old wooden chair<br />
I knew nobody<br />
Would look for me there<br />
. . . Sorrow and pity<br />
. . . Rule the earth and the skies<br />
Looking for nothing<br />
Anyone's eyes<br />
<br />
Once I had pretty girls<br />
Did me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city<br />
And the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Snowflakes are falling<br />
Around my head<br />
Lord have mercy<br />
It feel heavy like lead<br />
. . . I been hit too hard<br />
. . . Seen too much<br />
Nothing can heal me now<br />
But your touch<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty girl<br />
She done me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city<br />
And the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Loneliness<br />
Got a mind of its own<br />
The more people around<br />
The more you feel alone<br />
. . . I'm chained to the earth<br />
. . . Like a silent slave<br />
Trying to break free<br />
Out of death's dark cave<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty girl<br />
Done me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city<br />
And the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Boys in the street<br />
Beginning to play<br />
Girls like birds<br />
Flying away<br />
. . . I'm carrying the roses<br />
. . . That were given to me<br />
And I'm thinking about paradise<br />
<br>
Wondering what it might be<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty girl<br />
She done me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city<br />
And the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Go over to London<br />
Maybe gay Paree<br />
Follow the river<br />
You get to the sea<br />
. . . I was hoping we could drink from<br />
. . . Life's clear streams<br />
I was hoping we could dream<br />
Life's pleasant dreams<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty girl<br />
But she done me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city<br />
And the road ain't long<br />
<br />
Well the weak get weaker<br />
And the strong stay strong<br />
The train keeps rolling<br />
All night long<br />
. . . She looked at me<br />
. . . With an irresistible glance<br />
With a smile<br />
That could make all the planets dance<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty girl<br />
She did me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city<br />
And the road ain't long<br />
<br />
My house is on fire<br />
Burning to the skies<br />
I thought the rain clouds<br />
But the clouds passed by<br />
. . . When I'm gone<br />
. . . You'll remember my name<br />
I'm gonna win my way<br />
To wealth and fame<br />
<br />
Once I had a pretty girl<br />
But she did me wrong<br />
Now I'm marching to the city<br />
And the road ain't long<br />
<br />
I don't know</p>
