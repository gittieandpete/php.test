'Twas in the year of '92<br />
In the merry month of June<br />
I left my mother and a home so dear<br />
All for that girl on the greenbriar shore<br />
<br />
My mother, she says, "Son, don't go<br />
Don't leave me here alone<br />
Don't leave your mother and a home so dear<br />
Never trust a girl on the greenbriar shore"<br />
<br />
But I was young and reckless too<br />
And I craved a reckless life<br />
<br>
I left my mother and a home so dear<br />
And I took that girl to be my wife<br />
<br />
Her hair was dark and curly too<br />
And her lovin' eyes were blue<br />
Her cheeks were like the red red rose<br />
That girl I loved from the greenbriar shore<br />
<br />
The years rolled on and the months rolled by<br />
She left me all alone<br />
Now I remember what my mother said<br />
"Never trust the girl on the greenbriar shore"</p>
