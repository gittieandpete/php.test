Every time my baby and me we go up town<br />
Police come and they knock me down<br />
Cocaine all around my brain<br />
Hey baby, better come here quick.<br />
<br />
This old cocaine is 'bout to make me sick.<br />
Cocaine all around my brain.<br />
Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red<br />
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead.<br />
<br />
Cocaine all around my brain<br />
Hey baby, better come here quick.<br />
This old cocaine about to make me sick.<br />
Cocaine all around my brain.<br />
<br />
Hey baby, better come here quick<br />
<br>
This old cocaine 'bout to make me sick<br />
Cocaine all around my brain.<br />
Early one morning, half past four<br />
<br />
Cocaine came knockin' on my door.<br />
Cocaine all around my brain<br />
Hey baby, you better come here quick.<br />
This old cocaine is making me sick.<br />
<br />
Cocaine all around my brain.<br />
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men<br />
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when.<br />
Cocaine all around my brain.<br />
<br />
Hey baby, you better come here quick.<br />
This old cocaine about to make me sick.<br />
Cocaine all around my brain.</p>
