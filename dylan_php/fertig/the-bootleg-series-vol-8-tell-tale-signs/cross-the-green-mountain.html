I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream<br />
Heaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream<br />
Somethin' came up out of the sea<br />
Swept through the land of the rich and the free<br />
<br />
I look into the eyes of my merciful friend<br />
And then I ask myself, is this the end?<br />
Memories linger, sad yet sweet<br />
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet<br />
<br />
Altars are burnin' with flames far and wide<br />
The foe has crossed over from the other side<br />
They tip their caps from the top of the hill<br />
You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill<br />
<br />
Along the dim Atlantic line<br />
The ravaged land lies for miles behind<br />
The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad<br />
All must yield to the avengin' God<br />
<br />
The world is old, the world is gray<br />
Lessons of life can't be learned in a day<br />
I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand<br />
To the music that comes from a far better land<br />
<br />
Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know<br />
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low<br />
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend<br />
Killed outright he was, by his own men<br />
<br>
<br />
It's the last day's last hour of the last happy year<br />
I feel that the unknown world is so near<br />
Pride will vanish and glory will rot<br />
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot<br />
<br />
The bells of the evening have rung<br />
There's blasphemy on every tongue<br />
Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light<br />
And that I was loyal to truth and to right<br />
<br />
Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond<br />
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn<br />
In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood<br />
They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood<br />
<br />
Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star<br />
You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are<br />
Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost<br />
The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost<br />
<br />
A letter to mother came today<br />
Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say<br />
But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed<br />
But he'll never be better, he's already dead<br />
<br />
I'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away<br />
In an ancient light that is not of day<br />
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well<br />
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell</p>
