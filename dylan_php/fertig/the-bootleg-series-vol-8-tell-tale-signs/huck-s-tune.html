Well I wandered alone,<br />
Through a desert of stone,<br />
And I dreamed of my future wife.<br />
My sword's in my hand,<br />
And I'm next in command,<br />
In this version of Death called Life.<br />
My plate and my cup,<br />
Are right straight up,<br />
I took a rose from the hand of a child.<br />
When I kiss your lips,<br />
The honey drips,<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.<br />
<br />
Every day we meet,<br />
On any old street,<br />
And you're in your girlish prime.<br />
The short and the tall,<br />
Are coming to the ball,<br />
I go there all the time.<br />
Behind every tree,<br />
There's something to see,<br />
The river is wider than a mile.<br />
I tried you twice,<br />
You can't be nice,<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.<br />
<br />
Here come the nurse,<br />
With money in her purse,<br />
Here come the ladies and men.<br />
You push it all in,<br />
And you've no chance to win,<br />
You play 'em on down to the end.<br />
I'm laying in the sand,<br />
Getting a sunshine tan,<br />
<br>
Moving along, riding in style.<br />
From my toes to my head,<br />
You knock me dead,<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.<br />
<br />
I count the years,<br />
And I shed no tears,<br />
I'm blinded to what might have been.<br />
Nature's voice,<br />
Makes my heart rejoice,<br />
Play me the wild song of the wind.<br />
I found hopeless love,<br />
In the room above,<br />
When the sun and the weather were riled.<br />
You're as fine as wine,<br />
I ain't handing you no line,<br />
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.<br />
<br />
All the merry little elves,<br />
Can go hang themselves,<br />
My faith is as cold as can be.<br />
I'm stacked high to the roof,<br />
And I'm not without proof,<br />
If you don't believe me, come see.<br />
You think I'm blue,<br />
I think so, too,<br />
In my words you'll find no guile.<br />
The game's gotten old,<br />
The deck's gone cold,<br />
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.<br />
<br />
The game's gotten old,<br />
The deck's gone cold,<br />
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.</p>
