[Intro]<br />
The light in this place is really bad<br />
Like being at the bottom of a stream<br />
Any minute now<br />
I'm expecting to wake up from a dream<br />
<br />
[Verse 1]<br />
Means so much, the softest touch<br />
By the grave of some child, who neither wept or smiled<br />
I pondered my faith in the rain<br />
I've been dreaming' of you, that's all I do<br />
And it's driving me insane<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Somewhere dawn is breaking<br />
Light is streaking across the floor<br />
Church bells are ringing<br />
I wonder who they're ringing for<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Travel under any star<br />
You'll see me wherever you are<br />
The shadowy past is awake and so vast<br />
I'm sleeping in the palace of pain<br />
I've been dreaming' of you, that's all I do<br />
But it's driving me insane<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Maybe they'll get me, maybe they won't<br />
But whatever it won't be tonight<br />
I wish your hand was in mine right now<br />
We could go where the moon is white<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
<br>
For years they had me locked in a cage<br />
Then they threw me onto the stage<br />
Some things just last longer than you thought they would<br />
And they never, ever explain<br />
I've been dreaming' of you, that's all I do<br />
And it's driving me insane<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
Well, I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry<br />
Live my life on the square<br />
Even if the flesh falls off my face<br />
It won't matter, long as you're there<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
Feel like a ghost in love<br />
Underneath the heavens above<br />
Feel further away than I ever did before<br />
Feel further than I can take<br />
Dreaming' of you is all I do<br />
But it's driving me insane<br />
<br />
[Verse 8]<br />
Everything in the way is so shiny today<br />
A queer and unusual fall<br />
Spirals of golden haze, here and there in a blaze<br />
Like beams of light in the storm<br />
<br />
[Verse 9]<br />
Maybe you were here and maybe you weren't<br />
Maybe you touched somebody and got burnt<br />
The silent sun has got me on the run<br />
Burning a hole in my brain<br />
I'm dreaming' of you, that's all I do<br />
But it's driving me insane</p>
