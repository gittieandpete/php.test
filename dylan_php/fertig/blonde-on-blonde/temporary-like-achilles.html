Standing on your window honey<br />
Yes, I've been here before<br />
Feeling so harmless<br />
I'm looking at your second door<br />
How come you don't send me no regards ?<br />
You know I want your lovin'<br />
Honey, why are you so hard ?<br />
<br />
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling<br />
Yes, I guess I'll be here for a while<br />
I'm trying' to read your portrait, but<br />
I'm helpless, like a rich man's child<br />
How come you send someone out to have me barred ?<br />
You know I want your lovin'<br />
Honey, why are you so hard ?<br />
<br />
Like a poor fool in his prime<br />
Yes, I know you can hear me walk<br />
<br>
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime<br />
Or is it just solid rock ?<br />
<br />
Well, I rush into your hallway<br />
Lean against your velvet door<br />
I watch upon your scorpion<br />
Who crawls across your circus floor<br />
Just what do you think you have to guard ?<br />
You know I want your lovin'<br />
Honey, but you're so hard.<br />
<br />
Achilles is in your alleyway<br />
He don't want me here<br />
He does brag<br />
He's pointing to the sky<br />
And he's hungry, like a man in drag<br />
How come you get someone like him to be your guard ?<br />
You know I want your lovin'<br />
Honey, but you're so hard.</p>
