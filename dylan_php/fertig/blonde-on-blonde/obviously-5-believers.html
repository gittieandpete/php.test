Early in the mornin', early in the mornin' <br />
I'm callin' you to, I'm callin' you to please come home <br />
Yes, I guess I could make it without you <br />
If I just didn't feel so all alone <br />
<br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no I won't <br />
You know I can if you can, honey <br />
But, honey, please don't <br />
<br />
I got my black dog barkin', black dog barkin' <br />
Yes it is now, yes it is, outside my yard <br />
Yes, I could tell you what he means <br />
If I just didn't have to try so hard <br />
<br>
 <br />
Your mama's workin', your mama's moanin' <br />
She's cryin' you know, she's tryin' you know, you better go now <br />
Well, I'd tell you what she wants <br />
If I, but I just don't know how <br />
<br />
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers <br />
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men <br />
Tell your mama not to worry because <br />
Yes, they're just my friends <br />
<br />
Early in the mornin', early in the mornin' <br />
I'm callin' you to, I'm callin' you to please come home <br />
Yes, I could make it without you <br />
If I just didn't feel so all alone</p>
