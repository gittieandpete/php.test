With your mercury mouth in the missionary times,<br />
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes,<br />
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes,<br />
Oh, do they think could bury you?<br />
With your pockets well protected at last,<br />
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass,<br />
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass,<br />
Who could they get to carry you?<br />
<br />
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,<br />
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,<br />
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,<br />
Should I put them by your gate,<br />
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?<br />
<br />
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace,<br />
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace,<br />
And your basement clothes and your hollow face,<br />
Who among them can think he could outguess you?<br />
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims<br />
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims,<br />
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,<br />
Who among them would try to impress you?<br />
<br />
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,<br />
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,<br />
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,<br />
Should I put them by your gate,<br />
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?<br />
<br />
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list<br />
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss,<br />
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,<br />
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?<br />
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug,<br />
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs,<br />
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs,<br />
<br>
Who among them do you think could resist you?<br />
<br />
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,<br />
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,<br />
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,<br />
Should I leave them by your gate,<br />
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?<br />
<br />
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide<br />
To show you the dead angels that they used to hide.<br />
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?<br />
Oh, how could they ever mistake you?<br />
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,<br />
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm,<br />
And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,<br />
How could they ever, ever persuade you?<br />
<br />
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,<br />
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,<br />
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,<br />
Should I leave them by your gate,<br />
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?<br />
<br />
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row,<br />
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go,<br />
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,<br />
Who among them do you think would employ you?<br />
Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole<br />
With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold,<br />
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,<br />
Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?<br />
<br />
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,<br />
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,<br />
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,<br />
Should I leave them by your gate,<br />
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?</p>
