Early in the mornin'<br />
Early in the mornin'<br />
I'm callin' you to<br />
I'm callin' you to<br />
Please come home<br />
Yes, I guess, I could make it without you<br />
If I just didn't feel so all alone.<br />
<br />
Don't let me down<br />
Don't let me down<br />
I won't let your down<br />
I won't let your down<br />
No I won't<br />
You know I can if you can, honey<br />
But honey, please don't.<br />
<br />
I got my black dog barkin'<br />
Black dog barkin'<br />
Yes, it is now<br />
Yes, it is now<br />
Outside my yard<br />
Yes, I could tell you what he means<br />
If I just didn't have to try so hard.<br />
<br>
<br />
Your mama's workin'<br />
Your mama's moanin'<br />
She's cryin' you know<br />
She's cryin' you know<br />
You better go now<br />
Well, I'd tell you what she wants<br />
But I just don't know how.<br />
Fifteen jugglers<br />
Fifteen jugglers<br />
Five believers<br />
Five believers<br />
All dressed like men<br />
Tell yo' mama not to worry because<br />
They're just my friends.<br />
<br />
Early in the mornin'<br />
Early in the mornin'<br />
I'm callin' you to<br />
I'm callin' you to<br />
Please come home<br />
Yes, I guess, I could make it without you<br />
If I just didn't feel so all alone.</p>
