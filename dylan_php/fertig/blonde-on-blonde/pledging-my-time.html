Well, early in the morning<br />
'Til late at night<br />
I got a poison headache<br />
But I feel all right<br />
I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too.<br />
<br />
Well, the hobo got you high<br />
He came to me natur'ly<br />
After he stole my baby<br />
Then he wanted to steal me<br />
But I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too.<br />
<br />
Won't you come with me baby ?<br />
I'll take you where you wanna go<br />
And if I don't work out<br />
<br>
You'll be the first to know<br />
I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too.<br />
<br />
Well, the room is so stuffy<br />
I can hardly breathe<br />
Ev'rybody's gone but me and you<br />
And I can't be the last to leave<br />
I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too.<br />
<br />
Well, they sent for the ambulance<br />
And one was sent<br />
Somebody got lucky<br />
But it was an accident<br />
Now, I'm pledging my time to you<br />
Hopin' you'll come through too.</p>
