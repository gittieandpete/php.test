I didn't mean to treat you so bad<br />
You shouldn't take it so personal<br />
I didn't mean to make you so sad<br />
You just happened to be there, that's all<br />
When I saw you say goodbye to your friends and smile<br />
I thought that it was well understood<br />
That you'd be comin' back in a little while<br />
I didn't know that you were sayin' goodbye for good.<br />
<br />
But sooner or later one of us must know<br />
But you just did what you're supposed to do<br />
Sooner or later one of us must know<br />
That I really did try to get close to you.<br />
<br />
I couldn't see what you could show me<br />
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid<br />
I couldn't see how you could know me<br />
But you said you knew me and I believed you did<br />
When you whispered in my ear<br />
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her<br />
<br>
I didn't realize just what I did hear<br />
I didn't realize how young you were.<br />
<br />
But sooner or later one of us must know<br />
But you just doing what you're supposed to do<br />
Sooner or later one of us must know<br />
That I really did try to get close to you.<br />
<br />
I couldn't see when it started snowin'<br />
Your voice was all that I heard<br />
I couldn't see where we were goin'<br />
But you said you knew and I took your word<br />
And then you told me later as I apologized<br />
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm<br />
And I told you, as you clawed out my eyes<br />
That I never really meant to do you any harm.<br />
<br />
But sooner or later one of us must know<br />
But you just did what you're supposed to do<br />
Sooner or later one of us must know<br />
That I really did try to get close to you.</p>
