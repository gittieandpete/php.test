Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it<br />
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see<br />
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet<br />
With all these promises you left for me<br />
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie ?<br />
<br />
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick<br />
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me<br />
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic<br />
When you knew I had some other place to be<br />
Now where are you tonight, sweet Marie ? <br />
<br />
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously<br />
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.<br />
<br />
Well, six white horses that you did promise<br />
Were fin'ly delivered down to the penitentiary<br />
But to live outside the law, you must be honest<br />
<br>
I know you always say that you agree<br />
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie ?<br />
<br />
Well I don't know how it happened<br />
But the river-boat captain he knows my fate<br />
But ev'rybody else, even yourself<br />
They're just gonna have to wait.<br />
<br />
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets<br />
The Persian drunkard, he follows me<br />
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it<br />
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key<br />
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie ?<br />
<br />
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed<br />
That a man can't give his address out to bad company<br />
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad<br />
In the ruins of your balcony<br />
Wond'ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie ?</p>
