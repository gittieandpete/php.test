Well, I ride on a mail train, baby, can't buy a thrill<br />
Well, I been up all night leanin' on the windowsill<br />
Well, if I die on top of the hill<br />
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will<br />
<br />
Don't the moon look good, mama, shinin' through the trees<br />
Don't the brakemen look good, mama, flaggin' down the "Double-E"<br />
<br>
Don't the sun look good goin' down over the sea<br />
But don't my gal look fine when she's comin' after me<br />
<br />
Now, the wintertime is comin', the windows are filled with frost<br />
I went to tell everybody but I could not get across<br />
Well, I want to be your lover, baby, I don't want to be your boss<br />
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost</p>
