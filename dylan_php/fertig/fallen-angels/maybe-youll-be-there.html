Each time I see a crowd of people<br />
Just like a fool I stop and stare<br />
It's really not the proper thing to do<br />
But maybe you'll be there<br />
<br />
I go out walking after midnight<br />
Along the lonely thoroughfare<br />
It's not the time or place to look for you<br />
But maybe you'll be there<br />
<br>
<br />
You said your arms would always hold me<br />
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss<br />
Now after all those things you told me<br />
How can it end like this<br />
<br />
Someday if all my prayers are answered<br />
I'll hear a footstep on the stair<br />
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door<br />
And maybe you'll be there</p>
