Skylark<br />
Have you anything to say to me<br />
Won't you tell me where my love can be<br />
Is there a meadow in the mist<br />
Where someone's waiting to be kissed<br />
<br />
Skylark<br />
Have you seen a valley green with spring<br />
Where my heart can go a-journeying<br />
Over the shadows and the rain<br />
To a blossom covered lane<br />
<br>
<br />
And in your lonely flight<br />
Haven't you heard the music of the night<br />
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp<br />
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon<br />
<br />
Oh, Skylark<br />
I don't know if you can find these things<br />
But my heart is riding on your wings<br />
So if you see them anywhere<br />
Won't you lead me there</p>
