Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you<br />
If you're young at heart<br />
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind<br />
If you're young at heart<br />
<br />
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes<br />
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams<br />
And life gets more exciting with each passing day<br />
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way<br />
<br />
Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth<br />
To be young at heart<br />
<br>
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far<br />
To be young at heart<br />
<br />
And if you should survive to 105<br />
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive<br />
And here is the best part, you have a head start<br />
If you are among the very young at heart<br />
<br />
And if you should survive to 105<br />
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive<br />
And here is the best part, you have a head start<br />
If you are among the very young at heart</p>
