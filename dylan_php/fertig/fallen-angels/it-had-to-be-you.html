Why do I do just as you say<br />
Why must I just give you your way<br />
Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget<br />
<br />
It must have been that something lovers call fate<br />
Kept me saying, &quot;I have to wait&quot;<br />
I saw them all, just couldn't fall till we met<br />
It had to be you, it had to be you<br />
<br />
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who<br />
<br>
Could make me be true, could make me be blue<br />
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you<br />
<br />
Some others I've seen might never be mean<br />
Might never be cross or try to be boss but they wouldn't do<br />
For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still<br />
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you<br />
<br />
For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still<br />
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you</p>
