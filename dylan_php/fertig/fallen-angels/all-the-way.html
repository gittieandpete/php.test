When somebody loves you <br />
It's no good unless he loves you all the way <br />
Happy to be near you <br />
When you need someone to cheer you all the way <br />
<br />
Taller than the tallest tree is <br />
That's how it's got to feel <br />
Deeper than the deep blue sea is <br />
That's how deep it goes if it's real <br />
<br />
When somebody needs you <br />
It's no good unless she needs you all the way <br />
Through the good or lean years <br />
And for all those in-between years come what may <br />
<br>
<br />
Who knows where the road will lead us <br />
Only a fool would say <br />
But if you'll let me love you <br />
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way <br />
<br />
And when somebody needs you <br />
It's no good unless she needs you all the way <br />
And through the good or lean years <br />
And for all those in-between years come what may <br />
<br />
Who knows where the road will lead us <br />
Only a fool would say <br />
But if you'll let me love you <br />
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way</p>
