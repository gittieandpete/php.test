A country dance was being held in a garden<br />
I felt a bump and heard an, &quot;Oh, beg your pardon&quot;<br />
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams<br />
All around a pug-nosed dream<br />
<br />
The music started and was I the perplexed one<br />
I held my breath and said, &quot;May I have the next one?&quot;<br />
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams<br />
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream<br />
<br>
<br />
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers<br />
As we floated over the floor<br />
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers<br />
And perhaps a few things more<br />
<br />
Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter<br />
I know the meaning of the words, &quot;Ever after&quot;<br />
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams<br />
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream</p>
