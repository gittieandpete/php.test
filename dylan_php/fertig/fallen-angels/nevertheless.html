Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong<br />
Maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong<br />
But nevertheless I'm in love with you<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose<br />
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues<br />
But nevertheless I'm in love with you<br />
<br />
Somehow, I know at a glance<br />
The terrible chances I'm taking<br />
<br>
Fine at the start<br />
Then left with a heart that is breaking<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll live the life of regret<br />
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get<br />
But nevertheless I'm in love with you<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll live the life of regret<br />
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get<br />
But nevertheless I'm in love with you</p>
