That old black magic has weaved its spell<br />
That old black magic that you weave so well<br />
Those icy fingers up and down my spine<br />
 Same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine<br />
<br />
Same old tingle that I feel inside<br />
And then that elevator starts its ride<br />
And down and down I go, round and round I go<br />
Like a leaf caught in the tide<br />
<br />
I should stay away but what can I do?<br />
I hear your name and I'm aflame<br />
Aflame with burning desire<br />
That only your kiss can put out the fire<br />
<br />
You're the lover I have waited for<br />
You're the mate that fate had me created for<br />
And every time your lips meet mine<br />
<br />
Baby down and down I go, round and round I go<br />
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in<br />
Under that old black magic called love<br />
<br>
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in<br />
Under that old black magic called love<br />
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in<br />
Under that old black magic called love<br />
<br />
I should stay away but what can I do?<br />
I hear your name and I'm aflame<br />
Aflame with burning desire<br />
That only your kiss can put out the fire<br />
<br />
For you're the lover I have waited for<br />
You're the mate that fate had me created for<br />
And every time your lips meet mine<br />
<br />
Baby down and down I go, round and round I go<br />
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in<br />
I'm under that old black magic called love<br />
Oh in a spin, loving the spin I'm in<br />
Under that old black magic called love<br />
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in<br />
Under that old black magic called love<br />
Under that old black magic called love</p>
