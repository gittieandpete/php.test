All or nothing at all<br />
Half a love never appealed to me<br />
If your heart never could yield to me<br />
Then I'd rather have nothing at all<br />
<br />
All or nothing at all<br />
If it's love there is no in-between<br />
Why begin then cry for something that might have been<br />
No I'd rather have nothing at all<br />
<br />
<br>
Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek<br />
Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall<br />
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak<br />
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall<br />
<br />
And if I fell under the spell of your call<br />
I would be caught in the undertow<br />
And so you see, I've got to say &quot;No, no&quot;<br />
All or nothing at all<br />
<br />
All or nothing at all</p>
