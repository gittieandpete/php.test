Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways<br />
Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways<br />
I'm scared you will lead my poor body astray<br />
<br />
Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right<br />
Well, Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right<br />
For I dug on your grave the best part of last night<br />
<br />
She through her arms around him and she began to cry<br />
She through her arms around him and she began to cry<br />
I can't kill a woman that loves you such as I<br />
<br />
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand<br />
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand<br />
He drew out his dagger all in his right hand<br />
<br />
<br>
He pierced her in the heart and her lifeblood did run<br />
He pierced her in the heart the lifeblood did flow<br />
Deep in her grave Pretty Polly did go<br />
<br />
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home<br />
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home<br />
With nobody there but the wild birds to moan<br />
<br />
A debt to the devil Willie must pay<br />
A debt to the devil Willie must pay<br />
For killing Pretty Polly and running away<br />
<br />
Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands<br />
Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands<br />
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand<br />
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand</p>
