I saw it advertised one day<br />
Bear mountain picnic was comin' my way<br />
"Come along 'n' take a trip<br />
We'll bring you up there on a ship<br />
Bring the wife and kids<br />
Bring the whole family"<br />
Yippee Well, I run right down 'n' bought a ticket<br />
To this bear mountain picnic<br />
But little did I realize<br />
I was in for a picnic surprise<br />
Had nothin' to do with mountains<br />
I didn't even come close to a bear Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier<br />
Six thousand people there<br />
Everybody had ticket for the trip<br />
"Oh well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship<br />
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier" Well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think<br />
That big old boat started t' sink<br />
More people kept a-pilin' on<br />
That old ship was a-slowly goin' down<br />
Funny way t' start a picnic Well, I soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife<br />
So many people there I never saw in m' life<br />
That old ship sinkin' down in the water<br />
Six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other<br />
<br>
Dogs a-barkin', cats a-meowin'<br />
Women screamin', fists a-flyin', babies cryin'<br />
Cops a-comin', me a-runnin'<br />
Maybe we just better call off the picnic I got shoved down 'n' pushed around<br />
All I could hear there was a screamin' sound<br />
Don't remember one thing more<br />
Just remember walkin' up on a little shore<br />
Head busted, stomach cracked<br />
Feet splintered, I was bald, naked<br />
Quite lucky to be alive though Feelin' like I climbed outta m' casket<br />
I grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket<br />
Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home<br />
Wishin' I'd never got up that morn Now, I don't care just what you do<br />
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up t' you<br />
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it<br />
'Cause, see, I just lost all m' picnic spirit<br />
Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic<br />
In the bathroom Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny<br />
What some people are gonna do for money<br />
There's a bran' new gimmick every day<br />
Just t' take somebody's money away<br />
I think we oughta take some o' these people<br />
And put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to bear mountain<br />
For a picnic</p>
