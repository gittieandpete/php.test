[Verse 1]<br />
Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat<br />
Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat<br />
Well, you must tell me, baby<br />
How your head feels under something like that<br />
Under your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Well, you look so pretty in it<br />
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?<br />
Yes, I just want to see<br />
If it's really that expensive kind<br />
You know it balances on your head<br />
Just like a mattress balances<br />
On a bottle of wine<br />
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Well, if you want to see the sun rise<br />
Honey, I know where<br />
We'll go out and see it sometime<br />
We'll both just sit there and stare<br />
<br>
Me with my belt<br />
Wrapped around my head<br />
And you just sittin there<br />
In your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you<br />
It's bad for your health, he said<br />
Yes, I disobeyed his orders<br />
I came to see you<br />
But I found him there instead<br />
You know, I don't mind him cheatin on me<br />
But I sure wish he'd take that off his head<br />
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend<br />
You know, I never seen him before<br />
Well, I saw you making love with him<br />
You forgot to close the garage door<br />
You might think he loves you for your money<br />
But I know what he really loves you for:<br />
It's your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat</p>
