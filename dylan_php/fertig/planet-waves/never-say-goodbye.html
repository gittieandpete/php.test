Twilight on the frozen lake <br />
North wind about to break <br />
On footprints in the snow <br />
Silence down below. <br />
<br />
You're beautiful beyond words <br />
You're beautiful to me <br />
You can make me cry <br />
Never say goodbye. <br />
<br />
Time is all I have to give <br />
You can have it if you choose <br />
With me you can live <br />
Never say goodbye. <br />
<br>
 <br />
My dreams are made of iron and steel <br />
With a big bouquet <br />
Of roses hanging down <br />
From the heavens to the ground. <br />
<br />
The crashing waves roll over me <br />
As I stand upon the sand <br />
Wait for you to come <br />
And grab hold of my hand. <br />
<br />
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue <br />
You'll change your last name, too <br />
You've turned your hair to brown <br />
Love to see it hangin' down.</p>
