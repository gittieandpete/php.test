I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love<br />
I love you more than money and more than the stars above<br />
I love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea<br />
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.<br />
<br />
Ever since you walked right in the circle's been complete<br />
I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street<br />
In the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun<br />
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.<br />
<br />
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live<br />
When I was deep in powerty you taught me how to give<br />
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole<br />
I love you more than ever and it binds me to this all.<br />
<br />
You gave me babies, one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life<br />
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife<br />
My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie<br />
But I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.<br />
<br>
<br />
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth<br />
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth<br />
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood<br />
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.<br />
<br />
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large<br />
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge<br />
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend<br />
And if there is eternity I'd love you there again.<br />
<br />
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side<br />
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride<br />
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece<br />
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.<br />
<br />
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see<br />
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me<br />
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on<br />
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.</p>
