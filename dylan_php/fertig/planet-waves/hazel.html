Hazel, dirty blonde hair <br />
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere<br />
You got something I want plenty of <br />
Ooh, a little touch of your love.<br />
<br />
Hazel, stardust in your eye <br />
You're going somewhere and so am I<br />
I'd give you the sky high above <br />
Ooh, for a touch of your love.<br />
<br>
<br />
Oh no, I don't need any reminder <br />
To know how much I really care<br />
But it's just making me blinder and blinder<br />
Because I am up on the hill and still you're not there.<br />
<br />
Hazel, you called and I came <br />
Now don't make me play this waiting game<br />
You've got something I want plenty of <br />
Ooh, a little touch of your love.</p>
