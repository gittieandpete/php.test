Tough mama <br />
Meat shaking on your bones<br />
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stones<br />
Sister's on the highway with that steel drivin' crew<br />
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through<br />
Tough mama <br />
Can I blow a little smoke on you.<br />
<br />
Dark beauty <br />
Won't you move it on over and make somme room ?<br />
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom<br />
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise<br />
You came through it all the way flying through the skies<br />
Dark beauty <br />
With that long night's journey in you eyes.<br />
<br />
Sweet Goddess <br />
Born of a blinding light and a changing wind<br />
Now don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been<br />
<br>
Jack, the cowboy, went up north, he's buried in your past<br />
The lone wolf went out drinking, that was over pretty fast<br />
Sweet Goddess <br />
Your perfect stranger's coming in at last.<br />
<br />
Silver angel <br />
With the badge of the lonesome road written on your sleeve<br />
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive<br />
Today on the countryside it was a hotter than a crotch<br />
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch<br />
Sweet Goddess <br />
It must be time to carve another notch.<br />
<br />
I'm crestfallen <br />
The world of illusion is at my door<br />
I ain't a-haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore<br />
The prison walls are crumbling, there is no end in sight<br />
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite<br />
Sweet beauty <br />
Meet me at the border late tonight.</p>
