You angel you <br />
You got me under your wing<br />
The way you walk and the way you talk <br />
I feel I could almost sing.<br />
<br />
You angel you <br />
You're as fine as anything's fine<br />
I just want to watch you talk <br />
With your memory on my mind<br />
You know, I can't sleep at night for trying.<br />
<br />
Yes, I never did feel this way before<br />
I never did get up and walk the floor<br />
If this is love then give me more <br />
And more and more and more and more.<br />
<br>
<br />
You angel you <br />
You're as fine as can be<br />
The way you walk and the way you talk <br />
Is the way it ought to be.<br />
<br />
You know, I can't sleep at night for trying<br />
Never did feel this way before<br />
Never did get up and walk the floor<br />
If this is love then give me more <br />
And more and more and more and more.<br />
<br />
You angel you<br />
You got me under your wing<br />
The way you walk and the way you talk <br />
I swear it makes me sing.</p>
