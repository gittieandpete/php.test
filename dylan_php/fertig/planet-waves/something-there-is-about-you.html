Something there is about you that strikes a match in me<br />
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free<br />
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be<br />
Something that's crossed over from another century ?<br />
<br />
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth<br />
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth<br />
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth<br />
Something there is about you that brings back a long forgotten truth.<br />
<br>
<br />
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings<br />
Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things<br />
I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath<br />
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.<br />
<br />
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace<br />
I was in a whirlwind, now I am in some better place<br />
My hand's on the sabre and you've picked up on the baton<br />
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.</p>
