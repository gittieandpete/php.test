On a night like this <br />
I am so glad you came around<br />
Hold on to me so tight <br />
And heat up some coffee grounds<br />
We got much to talk about <br />
And much to reminisce<br />
It sure is right <br />
On a night like this.<br />
<br />
On a night like this <br />
So glad you've come to stay<br />
Hold on to me, pretty miss <br />
Say you'll never go away to stray<br />
Run your fingers down my spine <br />
Bring me a touch of bliss<br />
It sure feels right <br />
On a night like this.<br />
<br />
On a night like this <br />
I can't get any sleep<br />
<br>
The air is so cold outside <br />
And the snow's so deep<br />
Build a fire, throw on logs <br />
And listen to it hiss<br />
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn <br />
On a night like this.<br />
<br />
Put your body next to mine <br />
And keep me company<br />
There is plenty a room for all <br />
So please don't elbow me.<br />
<br />
Let the four winds blow <br />
Around this old cabin door<br />
If I'm not too far off <br />
I think we did this once before<br />
There's more frost on the window glass <br />
With each new tender kiss<br />
But it sure feels right <br />
On a night like this.</p>
