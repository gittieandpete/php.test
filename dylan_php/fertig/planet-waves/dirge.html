I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed<br />
You were just a painted face on a trip down to suicide road<br />
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel<br />
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.<br />
<br />
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed<br />
And the mercy that you showed to me, whoever would have guessed<br />
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within<br />
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.<br />
<br />
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped<br />
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped<br />
Like a slave in orbit he's beaten 'til he's tame<br />
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.<br />
<br>
<br />
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them<br />
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem<br />
The crystall ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet<br />
I've paid the price of solitude but at least I'm out of debt.<br />
<br />
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me<br />
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees<br />
We stared into each other's eyes 'till one of us would break<br />
No use to apologize, what difference would it make ?<br />
<br />
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine<br />
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen<br />
Lady Luck who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at<br />
I hate myself for loving you but I should get over that.</p>
