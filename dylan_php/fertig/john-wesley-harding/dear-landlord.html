Dear landlord<br />
Please don't put a price on my soul<br />
My burden is heavy<br />
My dreams are beyond control<br />
When that steamboat whistle blows<br />
I'm gonna give you all I got to give<br />
And I do hope you receive it well<br />
Depending on the way you feel that you live.<br />
<br />
Dear landlord<br />
Please heed these words that I speak<br />
I know you've suffered much<br />
But in this you are not so unique<br />
<br>
All of us, at times we might work too hard<br />
To have it too fast and too much<br />
And anyone can fill his life up<br />
With things he can see but he just cannot touch.<br />
<br />
Dear landlord<br />
Please don't dismiss my case<br />
I'm not about to argue<br />
I'm not about to move to no other place<br />
Now, each of us has his own special gift<br />
And you know this was meant to be true<br />
And if you don't underestimate me<br />
I won't underestimate you.</p>
