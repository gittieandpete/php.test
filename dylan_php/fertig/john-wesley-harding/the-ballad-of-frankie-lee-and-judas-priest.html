Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest<br />
They were the best of friends<br />
So when Frankie Lee needed more money one day<br />
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens<br />
And placed them on a footstool<br />
Just above the plotted plain<br />
Sayin', "Take your pick, Frankie Boy<br />
My loss will be your gain".<br />
<br />
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down<br />
And put his fingers to his chin<br />
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him<br />
His head began to spin<br />
"Would ya please not stare at me like that", he said<br />
"It's just my foolish pride<br />
But sometimes a man must be alone<br />
And this is no place to hide".<br />
<br />
Well, Judas he just winked and said<br />
"All right, I'll leave you here<br />
But you'd better hurry up and choose<br />
Which of those bills you want<br />
Before they all disappear"<br />
"I'm gonna start my pickin' right now<br />
Just tell me where you''ll be".<br />
<br />
Judas pointed down the road<br />
And said, "Eternity"<br />
"Eternity ?" said Frankie Lee<br />
With a voice as cold as ice<br />
"That's right", said Judas Priest, "Eternity<br />
Though you might call it Paradise"<br />
"I don't call it anything"<br />
Said Frankie Lee with a smile<br />
"All right", said Judas Priest<br />
"I'll see you after a while".<br />
<br />
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down<br />
Feelin' low and mean<br />
When just then a passing stranger<br />
Burst upon the scene<br />
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler<br />
Whose father is deceased ?<br />
Well, if you are<br />
There's a fellow callin' you down the road<br />
And they say his name is Priest".<br />
"Oh yes, he is my friend"<br />
Said Frankie Lee in fright<br />
"I do recall him very well<br />
<br>
In fact, he just left my sight"<br />
Yes, that's the one", said the stranger<br />
As quit as a mouse.<br />
"Well, my message is, he's down the road<br />
Stranded in a house".<br />
<br />
Well, Frankie Lee he panicked<br />
He dropped ev'rythimg and ran<br />
Until he came up to the spot<br />
Where Judas Priest did stand<br />
"What kind of a house is this", he said<br />
"Where I have come to roam ?"<br />
"It's not a house", said Judas Priest<br />
"It's not a house, it's a home".<br />
<br />
Well, Frankie Lee he trembled<br />
He soon lost all control<br />
Over ev'rything which he had made<br />
While the mission bells did toll<br />
He just stood there starring<br />
At that big house as bright as any sun<br />
With four and twenty windows<br />
And a woman's face in ev'ry one.<br />
<br />
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee<br />
With a soulful bounding leap<br />
And foaming at the mouth<br />
He began to make his midnight creep<br />
For sixteen nights and days he raved<br />
But on the seventeenth he burst<br />
Into the arms of Judas Priest<br />
Which is where he died of thirst.<br />
<br />
No one tried to say a thing<br />
When they carried him out in jest<br />
Except of course, the little neighbor boy<br />
Who carried him to rest<br />
And he just walked along alone<br />
Whit his guilt so well concealed<br />
And muttered underneath his breath<br />
"Nothing is revealed".<br />
Well, the moral of the story<br />
The moral of the song<br />
Is simply that one should never be<br />
Where ones does not belong<br />
So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin'<br />
Help him with his load<br />
And don't go mistaking Paradise<br />
For that home across the road.</p>
