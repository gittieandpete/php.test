As I went out one morning<br />
To breathe the air around Tom Paine's<br />
I spied the fairest damsel<br />
That ever did walk in chains<br />
I offer'd her my hand<br />
She took me by the arm<br />
I knew that very instant<br />
She meant to do me harm.<br />
<br />
"Depart from me this moment"<br />
I told her with my voice<br />
Said she, "But I don't wish to"<br />
Said I, "But you have no choice"<br />
<br>
"I beg you, sir", she pleaded<br />
From the corners of her mouth<br />
"I will secretly accept you<br />
And together we'll fly south".<br />
<br />
Just then Tom Paine, himself<br />
Came running from across the field<br />
Shouting at this lovely girl<br />
And commanding her to yield<br />
And as she was letting go her grip<br />
Up Tom Paine did run<br />
"I'm sorry, sir", he said to me<br />
"I'm sorry for what she'd done".</p>
