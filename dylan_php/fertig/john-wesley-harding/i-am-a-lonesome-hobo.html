I am a lonesome hobo<br />
Without family or friends<br />
Where another man's life might begin<br />
That's exactly where mine ends<br />
I have tried my hand at bribery<br />
Blackmail and deceit<br />
And I've served time for ev'rything<br />
'Cept begging on the street.<br />
<br />
Well, once I was rather prosperous<br />
There was nothing I did lack<br />
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth<br />
And silk upon my back<br />
<br>
But I did not trust my brother<br />
I carried him to blame<br />
Which led me to my fatal doom<br />
To wander off in shame.<br />
<br />
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen<br />
Soon I will be gone<br />
But let me just warn you all<br />
Before I do pass on:<br />
Stay free from petty jealousies<br />
Live by no man's code<br />
And hold your judgement for yourself<br />
Lest you wind up on his road.</p>
