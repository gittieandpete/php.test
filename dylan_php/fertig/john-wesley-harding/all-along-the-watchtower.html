"There must be some way out of here" <br />
Said the joker to the thief <br />
"There's too much confusion <br />
I can't get no relief <br />
<br />
Businessmen, they drink my wine <br />
Plowmen dig my earth <br />
None of them along the line <br />
Know what any of it is worth" <br />
<br />
"No reason to get excited" <br />
The thief, he kindly spoke <br />
"There are many here among us <br />
Who feel that life is but a joke <br />
<br>
<br />
But you and I, we've been through that <br />
And this is not our fate <br />
So let us not talk falsely now <br />
The hour is getting late" <br />
<br />
All along the watchtower <br />
Princes kept the view <br />
While all the women came and went <br />
Barefoot servants too <br />
<br />
Outside in the distance <br />
A wildcat did growl <br />
Two riders were approaching <br />
The wind began to howl</p>
