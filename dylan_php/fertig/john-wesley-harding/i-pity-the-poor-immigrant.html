I pity the poor immigrant<br />
Who wishes he would've stayed home<br />
Who uses all his power to do evil<br />
But in the end is always left so alone<br />
That man whom with his fingers cheats<br />
And who lies with ev'ry breath<br />
Who passionately hates his life<br />
And likewise fears his death.<br />
<br />
I pity the poor immigrant<br />
Whose strength is spent in vain<br />
Whose heaven is like Ironsides<br />
Whose tears are like rain<br />
<br>
Who eats but is not satisfied<br />
Who hears but does not see<br />
Who falls in love with wealth itself<br />
And turns his back on me.<br />
<br />
I pity the poor immigrant<br />
Who tramples through the mud<br />
Who fills his mouth with laughing<br />
And who builds his town with blood<br />
Whose visions in the final end<br />
Must shatter like the glass<br />
I pity the poor immigrant<br />
When his gladness comes to pass.</p>
