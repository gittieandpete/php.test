I dreamed I saw St. Augustine<br />
Alive as you or me<br />
Tearing through these quarters<br />
In the utmost misery<br />
With a blanket underneath his arm<br />
And a coat of solid gold<br />
Searching for the very souls<br />
Whom already have been sold<br />
<br />
Arise, arise, he cried so loud<br />
In a voice without restraint<br />
Come out, ye gifted kings and queens<br />
And hear my sad complaint<br />
<br>
No martyr is among ye now<br />
Whom you can call your own<br />
So go on your way accordingly<br />
But know you're not alone<br />
<br />
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine<br />
Alive with fiery breath<br />
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones<br />
That put him out to death<br />
Oh, I awoke in anger<br />
So alone and terrified<br />
I put my fingers against the glass<br />
And bowed my head and cried</p>
