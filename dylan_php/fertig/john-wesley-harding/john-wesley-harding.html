John Wesley Harding <br />
Was a friend to the poor<br />
He trav'led with a gun in ev'ry hand<br />
All along this countryside<br />
He opened a many a door<br />
But he was never known<br />
To hurt a honest man.<br />
<br />
It was down in Chaynee County<br />
A time they talk about<br />
With his lady by his side<br />
He took a stand<br />
<br>
And soon the situation there<br />
Was all but straightened out<br />
For he was always known<br />
To lend a helping hand.<br />
<br />
All across the telegraph<br />
His name it did resound<br />
But no charge held against him<br />
Could they prove<br />
And there was no man around<br />
Who could track or chain him down<br />
He was never known<br />
To make a foolish move.</p>
