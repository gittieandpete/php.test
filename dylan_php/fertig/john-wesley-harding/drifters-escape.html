Oh, help me in my weakness<br />
I heard the drifter say<br />
As they carried him from the courtroom<br />
And were taking him away<br />
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one<br />
And my time it isn't long<br />
And I still do not know<br />
What it was that I've done wrong.<br />
<br />
Well, the judge he cast his robe aside<br />
A tear came to his eye<br />
"You failed to understand", he said<br />
"Why must you even try ?"<br />
<br>
Outside the crowd was stirring<br />
You could hear it from the door<br />
Inside the judge was stepping down<br />
While the jury cried for more.<br />
<br />
"Oh, stop that cursed jury"<br />
Cried the attendant and the nurse<br />
"The trial was bad enough<br />
But this is ten times worse"<br />
Just then a bolt of lightning<br />
Struck the courthouse out of shape<br />
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray<br />
The drifter did escape.</p>
