There was a wicked messenger<br />
From Eli he did come<br />
With a mind that multiplied<br />
The smallest matter<br />
When questioned who had sent for him<br />
He answered with his thumb<br />
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.<br />
<br />
He stayed behind the assembly hall<br />
It was there he made his bed<br />
<br>
Oftentimes he could be seen returning<br />
Until one day he just appeared<br />
With a note in his hand which read<br />
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning"<br />
<br />
Oh, the leaves began to fallin'<br />
And the seas began to part<br />
And the people that confronted him were many<br />
And he was told but these few words<br />
Which opened up his heart<br />
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any".</p>
