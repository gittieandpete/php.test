Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother.<br />
She's sleeping here right by my side<br />
And in her right hand a silver dagger,<br />
She says that I can't be your bride. "All men are false", says my mother,<br />
"They'll tell you wicked, lovin' lies.<br />
The very next evening, they'll court another,<br />
<br>
Leave you alone to pine and sigh." My daddy is a handsome devil<br />
He's got a chain five miles long,<br />
And on every link a heart does dangle<br />
Of another maid he's loved and wronged. Go court another tender maiden,<br />
And hope that she will be your wife,<br />
For I've been warned, and I've decided<br />
To sleep alone all of my life.</p>
