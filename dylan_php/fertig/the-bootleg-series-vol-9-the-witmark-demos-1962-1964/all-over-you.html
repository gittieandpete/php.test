[Verse 1]<br />
Well, if I had to do it all over again<br />
Babe, I'd do it all over you<br />
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years<br />
Babe, I'd even do that too<br />
Well, a dog's got his bone in the alley<br />
A cat, she's got nine lives<br />
A millionaire's got a million dollars<br />
King Saud's got four hundred wives<br />
Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'<br />
That they're looking' forward to<br />
I'm looking' forward to when I can do it all again<br />
And babe, I'll do it all over you<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today<br />
Babe, I'd run circles all around<br />
I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin<br />
I'd even dance a jig on the ground<br />
Well, everybody gets their hour<br />
Everybody gets their time<br />
Little David when he picked up his pebbles<br />
Even Sampson after he went blind<br />
Well, everybody gets the chance<br />
To do what they want to do<br />
When my time arrives you better run for your life<br />
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Well, I don't need no money, I just need a day that's sunny<br />
Baby, and my days are gonna come<br />
And I grab me a pint, you know that I'm a giant<br />
When you hear me yelling', “Fee-fi-fo-fum”<br />
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle<br />
You made me to a walk-in' wreck<br />
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone<br />
Then you knocked off my head from my neck<br />
Well, if I'm ever stand-in' steady<br />
A-doin' what I want to do<br />
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover<br />
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
I'm just resting' at your gate so that I won't be late<br />
And, momma, I'm a-just sitting' on the shelf<br />
Look out your window fair and you'll see me squatting' there<br />
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumbling' to myself<br />
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up<br />
After all my liquor's been drunk<br />
After my dreams are dreamed out<br />
After all my thoughts have been sunk<br />
Well, after I do some of these things<br />
I'm gonna do what I have to do<br />
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide<br />
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you</p>
