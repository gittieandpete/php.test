[Verse 1]<br />
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Trying to bum a ride, Trying to bum a ride<br />
Trying to bum a ride<br />
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Trying to bum a ride, Trying to bum a ride<br />
Trying to bum a ride<br />
Nobody seem to know me<br />
Everybody pass me by<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Trying to hold up, Trying to hold up<br />
Trying to hold up and be brave<br />
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Trying to hold up, Trying to hold up and be brave<br />
One road's going to the bright lights<br />
The other's going down to my grave<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Well, I'm looking down at two cards<br />
They seem to be handmade<br />
Well, I'm looking down at two cards<br />
They seem to be handmade<br />
One looks like it's the ace of diamonds<br />
The other looks like it is the ace of spades<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
<br>
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Watching my life roll by<br />
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Watching my life roll by<br />
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Trying to bum a ride<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Wondering where everybody went<br />
Wondering where everybody went<br />
Wondering where everybody went<br />
Well, I'm standing on the highway<br />
Wondering where everybody went<br />
Wondering where everybody went<br />
Wondering where everybody went<br />
Please mister, pick me up<br />
I swear I ain't gonna kill nobody's kids<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
I wonder if my good gal<br />
I wonder if she knows I'm here<br />
Nobody else seems to know I'm here<br />
I wonder if my good gal<br />
I wonder if she knows I'm here<br />
Nobody else seems to know I'm here<br />
If she knows I'm here, Lawd<br />
I wonder if she said a prayer</p>
