[Verse 1]<br />
Sad I'm a-sittin' on the railroad track<br />
Watching' that old smokestack<br />
Train is a-leavin' but it won't be back<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Years ago we hung around<br />
Watching' trains roll through the town<br />
Now that train is a-graveyard bound<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Where we go up in that North Country<br />
Lakes and streams and mines so free<br />
I had no better friend than he<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
Something happened to him that day<br />
I thought I heard a stranger say<br />
I hung my head and stole away<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
A diesel truck was rolling' slowly<br />
Pulling' down a heavy load<br />
It left him on a Utah road<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
They carried him back to his home town<br />
His mother cried, his sister moaned<br />
Listening' to them church bells tone</p>
