[Verse 1]<br />
My parents raised me tenderly<br />
I was their only son<br />
My mind got mixed with rambling<br />
When I was all so young<br />
And I left my home the first time<br />
When I was twelve and one<br />
I'm a long time a-comin', Maw<br />
An' I'll be a long time gone<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
On the western side of Texas<br />
On the Texas plains<br />
I tried to find a job o' work<br />
But they said l's young of age<br />
My eyes they burned when I heard<br />
“Go home where you belong!”<br />
I'm a long time a-comin'<br />
An' I'll be a long time gone<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
I remember when I's rambling<br />
Around with the carnival trains<br />
Different towns, different people<br />
Somehow they're all the same<br />
I remember children's faces best<br />
I remember traveling on<br />
I'm a long time a-comin'<br />
I'll be a long time gone<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
I once loved a fair young maid<br />
An' I ain't too big to tell<br />
If she broke my heart a single time<br />
She broke it ten or twelve<br />
I walked and talked all by myself<br />
I did not tell no one<br />
I'm a long time a-comin', babe<br />
An' I'll be a long time gone<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Many times by the highwayside<br />
I tried to flag a ride<br />
With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth<br />
I'd watch the cars roll by<br />
The empty air hung in my head<br />
I's thinkin' all day long<br />
I'm a long time a-comin'<br />
I'll be a long time gone<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
You might see me on your crossroads<br />
When I'm a-passin' through<br />
Remember me how you wished to<br />
As I'm a-Driftin' from your view<br />
I ain't got the time to think about it<br />
I got too much to get done<br />
Well, I'm a long time coming<br />
An' I'll be a long time gone<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
If I can't help somebody<br />
With a word or song<br />
If I can't show somebody<br />
They are traveling' wrong<br />
But I know I ain't no prophet<br />
An' I ain't no prophet's son<br />
I'm just a long time a-comin'<br />
An' I'll be a long time gone<br />
<br />
[Verse 8]<br />
So you can have your beauty<br />
It's skin deep and it only lies<br />
And you can have your youth<br />
It'll rot before your eyes<br />
Just give to me my gravestone<br />
With it clearly carved upon:<br />
“I's a long time a-comin'<br />
An' I'll be a long time gone”</p>
