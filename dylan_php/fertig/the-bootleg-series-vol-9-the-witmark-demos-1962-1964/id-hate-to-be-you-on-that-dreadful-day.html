[Verse 1]<br />
Well, your clock is gonna stop<br />
At Saint Peter's gate<br />
Ya gonna ask him what time it is<br />
He's gonna say, “It's too late”<br />
Hey, hey!<br />
I'd sure hate to be you<br />
On that dreadful day<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
You're gonna start to sweat<br />
And you ain't gonna stop<br />
You're gonna have a nightmare<br />
And never wake up<br />
Hey, hey, hey!<br />
I'd sure hate to be you<br />
On that dreadful day<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
You're gonna cry for pills<br />
And your head's gonna be in a knot<br />
But the pills are gonna cost more<br />
Than what you've got<br />
Hey, hey!<br />
I'd sure hate to be you<br />
On that dreadful day<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
You're gonna have to walk naked<br />
Can't ride in no car<br />
You're gonna let ev'rybody see<br />
Just what you are<br />
Hey, hey!<br />
I'd sure hate to be you<br />
On that dreadful day<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
Well, the good wine's a-flowing<br />
For five cents a quart<br />
You're gonna look in your moneybags<br />
And find you're one cent short<br />
Hey, hey, hey!<br />
I'd sure hate to be you<br />
On that dreadful day<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
You're gonna yell and scream<br />
“Don't anybody care?”<br />
You're gonna hear out a voice say<br />
“Shoulda listened when you heard the word down there”<br />
Hey, hey!<br />
I'd sure hate to be you<br />
On that dreadful day</p>
