I will not go down under the ground<br />
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming around<br />
An' I will not carry myself down to die<br />
When I go to my grave my head will be high<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before I go down under the ground<br />
<br />
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been<br />
The meaning of life has been lost in the wind<br />
And some people thinking that the end is close by<br />
'Stead of learning' to live they are learning' to die<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before I go down under the ground<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'm smart but I think I can see<br />
When someone is pulling the wool over me<br />
And if this war comes and death's all around<br />
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before I go down under the ground<br />
<br>
<br />
There's always been people that have to cause fear<br />
They've been talking of the war now for many long years<br />
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word<br />
But now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before I go down under the ground<br />
<br />
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood<br />
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood<br />
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves<br />
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace<br />
Let me die in my footsteps<br />
Before I go down under the ground<br />
<br />
Go out in your country where the land meets the sun<br />
See the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run<br />
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho<br />
Let every state in this union seep down deep in your souls<br />
And you'll die in your footsteps<br />
Before you go down under the ground</p>
