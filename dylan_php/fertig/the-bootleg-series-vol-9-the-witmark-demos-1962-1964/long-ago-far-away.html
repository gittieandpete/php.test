[Verse 1]<br />
To preach of peace and brotherhood<br />
Oh, what might be the cost!<br />
A man he did it long ago<br />
And they hung him on a cross<br />
Long ago, far away<br />
These things don't happen<br />
No more, nowadays<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
The chains of slaves they dragged the ground<br />
With heads and hearts hung low<br />
But it was during Lincoln's time<br />
And it was long ago<br />
Long ago, far away<br />
Things like that don't happen<br />
No more, nowadays<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
The war guns they went off wild<br />
The whole world bled its blood<br />
Men's bodies floated on the edge<br />
<br>
Of oceans made of mud<br />
Long ago, far away<br />
Those kind of things don't happen<br />
No more, nowadays<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
One man had much money<br />
One man had not enough to eat<br />
One man he lived just like a king<br />
The other man begged on the street<br />
Long ago, far away<br />
Things like that don't happen<br />
No more, nowadays<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
One man died of a knife so sharp<br />
One man died from the bullet of a gun<br />
One man died of a broken heart<br />
To see the lynching' of his son<br />
Long ago, far away<br />
Things like that don't happen<br />
No more, nowadays</p>
