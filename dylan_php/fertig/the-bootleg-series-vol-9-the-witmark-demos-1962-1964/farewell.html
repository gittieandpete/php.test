[Verse 1]<br />
Oh it's fare thee well my darling' true<br />
I'm leaving' in the first hour of the morn<br />
I'm bound off for the bay of Mexico<br />
Or maybe the coast of Californ<br />
So it's fare thee well my own true love<br />
We'll meet another day, another time<br />
It ain't the leavin'<br />
That's a-grievin' me<br />
But my true love who's bound to stay behind<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard<br />
And the rain she's a-turnin' into hail<br />
I still might strike it lucky on a highway going' west<br />
Though I'm traveling' on a path beaten trail<br />
So it's fare thee well my own true love<br />
We'll meet another day, another time<br />
It ain't the leaving'<br />
That's a-grievin' me<br />
But my true love who's bound to stay behind<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
I will write you a letter from time to time<br />
As I'm rambling' you can travel with me too<br />
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love<br />
I will send what I learn back home to you<br />
<br>
So it's fare thee well my own true love<br />
We'll meet another day, another time<br />
It ain't the leaving'<br />
That's a-grievin' me<br />
But my true love who's bound to stay behind<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles<br />
Be them somebody else's or my own<br />
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high<br />
I will travel unnoticed and unknown<br />
So it's fare thee well my own true love<br />
We'll meet another day, another time<br />
It ain't the leaving<br />
That's a-grievin' me<br />
But my true love who's bound to stay behind<br />
<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
I've heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound<br />
It's down around the old Mexican plains<br />
They say that the people are all friendly there<br />
And all they ask of you is your name<br />
So it's fare thee well my own true love<br />
We'll meet another day, another time<br />
It ain't the leaving<br />
That's a-grievin' me<br />
But my true love who's bound to stay behind</p>
