Sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna leave my lonesome home<br />
And sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna hear my milk cow moan<br />
And sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna hit the highway road<br />
But then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said<br />
Oh babe, i'm in the mood for you.<br />
<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, lord, i had my overflowin' fill<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i'm gonna make out my final will<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i'm gonna head for the walkin' hill<br />
But then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said<br />
Oh babe, i'm in the mood for you.<br />
<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna lay right down and die<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna climb up to the sky<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i'm gonna laugh until i cry<br />
But then again, i said again, i said again, i said<br />
Oh babe, i'm in the mood for you.<br />
<br />
<br>
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i'm gonna sleep in my pony's stall<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i ain't gonna do nothin' at all<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna fly like a cannon ball<br />
But then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said<br />
Oh babe, i'm in the mood for you.<br />
<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna back up against the wall<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna run till i have to crawl<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i ain't gonna do nothin' at all<br />
But then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said<br />
Oh babe, i'm in the mood for you.<br />
<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i wanna change my house around<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i'm gonna make a change in this here town<br />
Sometimes i'm in the mood, i'm gonna change the world around<br />
But then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said<br />
Oh babe, i'm in the mood for you.<br />
