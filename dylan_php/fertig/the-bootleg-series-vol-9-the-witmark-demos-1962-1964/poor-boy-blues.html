[Verse 1]<br />
Mm, tell mama<br />
Where'd you sleep last night?<br />
Can't you hear me crying?<br />
Hm, hm, hm<br />
<br />

Hey, tell me baby<br />

Can't you hear me crying?<br />
Hm, hm, hm<br />

Hey, Mister Bartender<br />
I swear I'm not too young<br />
Can't you hear me crying?<br />

Blow your whistle, policeman<br />

My poor feet are trained to run<br />
Can't you hear me crying?<br />
Hm, hm, hm<br />

Long-distance operator<br />
I hear this phone call is on the house<br />

Ashes and diamonds<br />
The diff'rence I Can't see<br />

Mister Judge and Jury<br />
Can't you see the shape I'm in?<br />
Don't you hear me crying?<br />
Hm, hm, hm<br />

Mississippi River<br />
