'Twas down in Mississippi not so long ago,<br />
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a<br />
Southern door.<br />
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well,<br />
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till.<br />
<br />
Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up.<br />
They said they had a reason, but I disremember what.<br />
They tortured him and did some evil things too evil to<br />
repeat.<br />
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was<br />
laughing sounds out on the street.<br />
<br />
Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a blood-red rain<br />
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his<br />
screaming pain.<br />
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it <br />
ain't no lie,<br />
He was a black-skinned boy, so<br />
he was born to die.<br />
<br />
And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial,<br />
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor<br />
<br>
Emmett Till.<br />
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers<br />
commit this awful crime,<br />
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind.<br />
<br />
I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see<br />
The smiling brothers walkin' down the courthouse stairs.<br />
For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free,<br />
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea.<br />
<br />
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime<br />
that's so unjust,<br />
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is<br />
filled with dust.<br />
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and<br />
your blood it must refuse to flow,<br />
For you let this human race fall down so God-awful low!<br />
<br />
This song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man<br />
That this kind of thing still lives today in that<br />
ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan.<br />
But if all us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we<br />
could give,<br />
We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live.</p>
