When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies"<br />
I cried she was deaf<br />
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes<br />
And saying "What else you got left?"<br />
<br />
It was then that I got up to leave<br />
But she said, "Don't forget<br />
Everybody must give something back<br />
For something they get"<br />
<br />
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum<br />
I asked her how come<br />
And she buttoned her boot, and straightened her suit<br />
And she said, "Don't be cute"<br />
<br />
So I forced my hands in my pockets<br />
And felt with my thumbs<br />
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum<br />
<br />
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt<br />
Where everyone walked<br />
But, when finding out I'd forgotten my shirt<br />
<br>
I went back and knocked<br />
<br />
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it<br />
And I tried to make sense<br />
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair<br />
That leaned up against<br />
<br />
Her Jamaican rum, and when she did come<br />
I asked her for some<br />
She said, "No, dear", I said, "Your words are not clear<br />
You'd better spit out your gum"<br />
<br />
She screamed till her face got so red<br />
Then she fell on the floor<br />
I covered her up and then went and looked through her drawer<br />
<br />
And, when I was through, I filled up my shoe<br />
And brought it to you<br />
And you, you took me in, you loved me then<br />
You didn't waste time<br />
And I, I never took much, I never asked for your crutch<br />
Now don't ask for mine</p>
