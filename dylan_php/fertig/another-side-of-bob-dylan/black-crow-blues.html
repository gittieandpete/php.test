I woke in the mornin' wand'rin'<br />
Worried and worn out<br />
I woke in the mornin' wand'rin'<br />
Worried and worn out<br />
Wishin' my long-lost lover<br />
Will walk to me, talk to me<br />
Tell me what it's all about.<br />
<br />
I was standin' at the side road<br />
Listenin' to the billboard knock<br />
Standin' at the side road<br />
Listenin' to the billboard knock<br />
Well, my wrist was empty<br />
But my nerves were kickin'<br />
Thickin' like a clock.<br />
<br />
If I got anything you need, babe<br />
Let me tell you in front<br />
If I got anything you need, babe<br />
<br>
Let me tell you in front<br />
You can come to me sometime<br />
Night time, day time<br />
Any time you want.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I'm thinkin I'm<br />
To high to fall<br />
Sometimes I'm thinkin I'm<br />
To high to fall<br />
Other times I'm thinkin' I'm<br />
So low I don't know<br />
If I can come up at all.<br />
<br />
Black crows in the meadow<br />
Sleeping across a broad highway<br />
Black crows in the meadow<br />
Across a broad highway<br />
Though its funny, honey<br />
I just don't feel much like a<br />
Scarecrow today.</p>
