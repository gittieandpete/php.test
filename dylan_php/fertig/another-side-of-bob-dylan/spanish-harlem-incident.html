Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem<br />
Cannot hold you to its heat<br />
Your temperature's too hot for taming<br />
Your flaming feet burn up the street<br />
I am homeless, come and take me<br />
To the reach of your rattling drums<br />
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune<br />
Down alone my restless palms.<br />
<br />
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed<br />
I have fallen far beneath<br />
Your pearly eyes, so fast an' slashing<br />
An' your flashing diamond teeth<br />
<br>
The night is pitch black, come an' make my<br />
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!<br />
Let me know, babe, I am nearly drowning<br />
If it's you my lifelines trace.<br />
<br />
I been wond'rin' all about me<br />
Ever since I seen you there<br />
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding<br />
I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where<br />
You've slayed me, you have made me<br />
I got to laugh halfways off my heels<br />
I got to know, babe, will you surround me<br />
So I can know if I'm really real.</p>
