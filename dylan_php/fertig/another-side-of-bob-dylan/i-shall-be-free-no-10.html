I'm just average, common too<br />
I'm just like him, the same as you<br />
I'm everybody's brother and son<br />
I ain't different than anyone<br />
It ain't no use a-talking to me <br />
It's just the same as talking to you.<br />
<br />
I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day<br />
<br>
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay<br />
I said "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay here I come<br />
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine<br />
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run <br />
99, 100 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you<br />
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleenf.<br />
<br />
Well, I don't know, but I've been told<br />
The streets in heaven are lined with gold</p>
