I pounded on a farmhouse<br />
Lookin' for a place to stay<br />
I was mighty, mighty tired<br />
I had come a long, long way<br />
<br />
I said "Hey hey in there<br />
Is there anybody home?"<br />
I was standin' on the steps<br />
Feelin' most alone<br />
<br />
When out comes a farmer<br />
He must have thought that I was nuts<br />
He immediately looked at me<br />
And stuck a gun into my guts<br />
<br />
I fell down to<br />
My bended knees<br />
Saying "I dig farmers<br />
Don't shoot me, please"<br />
<br />
He cocked his rifle<br />
And began to shout<br />
"Are you that travelin' salesman<br />
That I have heard about?"<br />
<br />
I said "No, no, no<br />
I'm a doctor and it's true<br />
I'm a clean-cut kid<br />
And I been to college too"<br />
<br />
Then in comes his daughter<br />
Whose name was Rita<br />
She looked like she stepped<br />
Out of La Dolce Vita<br />
<br />
I immediately tried to cool it<br />
With her dad<br />
And told him what a nice<br />
Pretty farm he had<br />
<br />
He said "What do doctors know<br />
About farms, pray tell?"<br />
I said "I was born at the bottom<br />
Of a wishing well"<br />
<br />
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails<br />
I guess he knew I wouldn't lie<br />
He said "I guess you're tired"<br />
He said it kind of sly<br />
<br />
I said "Yes, ten thousand miles<br />
Today I drove"<br />
He said "I got a bed for you<br />
Underneath the stove<br />
<br />
Just one condition<br />
You can go to sleep right now<br />
That you don't touch my daughter<br />
And in the morning, milk the cows"<br />
<br />
I was sleepin' like a rat<br />
When I heard something jerkin'<br />
There stood Rita<br />
Lookin' just like Tony Perkins<br />
<br />
She said "Would you like to take a shower?<br />
I'll show you up to the door"<br />
<br>
I said "Oh, no, no<br />
I've been through this movie before"<br />
<br />
I knew I had to split<br />
But I did not know how<br />
When she said<br />
"Would you like to take that shower now?"<br />
<br />
Well, I couldn't leave<br />
Unless the old man chased me out<br />
'Cause I'd already promised<br />
That I'd milk his cows<br />
<br />
I had to say something<br />
To strike him very weird<br />
So I yelled<br />
"I like Fidel Castro and his beard"<br />
<br />
Rita looked offended<br />
But she got out of the way<br />
As he came charging down the stairs<br />
Sayin' "What's that I heard you say?"<br />
<br />
I said, "I like Fidel Castro<br />
I think you heard me right"<br />
And I ducked as he swung<br />
At me with all his might<br />
<br />
Rita mumbled something<br />
'Bout her mother on the hill<br />
As his fist, it hit the icebox<br />
He said he's going to kill<br />
<br />
Me if I don't get out the door<br />
In two seconds flat<br />
"You unpatriotic<br />
Rotten doctor Commie rat"<br />
<br />
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest<br />
At my head and I did run<br />
I did a somersault<br />
As I seen him get his gun<br />
<br />
And crashed through the window<br />
At a hundred miles an hour<br />
And landed fully blast<br />
In his garden flowers<br />
<br />
Rita said "Come back"<br />
And he started to load<br />
The sun was comin' up<br />
And I was runnin' down the road<br />
<br />
Well, I don't figure I'll be back<br />
There for a spell<br />
Even though Rita moved away<br />
And got a job at a motel<br />
<br />
He still waits for me<br />
Constant on the sly<br />
He wants to turn me in<br />
To the F.B.I<br />
<br />
Me, I romp and stompings<br />
Thankful as I romp<br />
Without freedom of speech<br />
I might be in the swamp</p>
