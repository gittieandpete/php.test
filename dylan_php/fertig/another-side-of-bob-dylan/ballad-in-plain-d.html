I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze<br />
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn<br />
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone<br />
Gone as the season she's taken.<br />
<br />
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away<br />
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay<br />
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day<br />
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.<br />
<br />
Of the two sister, I loved the young<br />
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one<br />
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone<br />
By the jealousy of others around her.<br />
<br />
For her parasite sister, I had no respect<br />
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect<br />
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect<br />
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.<br />
<br />
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused<br />
The changes I was going through can't even be used<br />
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose<br />
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.<br />
<br />
With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip<br />
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped<br />
Noticing not that I'd already slipped<br />
To a sin of love's false security.<br />
<br />
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace<br />
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies<br />
<br>
Till the tombstones of damage read me no question but, "Please<br />
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter ?"<br />
<br />
And so it did happen, like it could have been foreseen<br />
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream<br />
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen<br />
Tumbled all down into pieces.<br />
<br />
"The tragic figure" her sister did shout<br />
"Leave her alone, God damn you, get out"<br />
And I in my armor, turning about<br />
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.<br />
<br />
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound<br />
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground<br />
And she in between, the victim of sound<br />
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.<br />
<br />
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight<br />
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight<br />
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night<br />
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.<br />
<br />
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet<br />
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet<br />
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met<br />
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.<br />
<br />
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me<br />
"How good, how good does it feel to be free "?<br />
And I answer them most mysteriously<br />
"Are birds free from the chains of the skyway"?</p>
