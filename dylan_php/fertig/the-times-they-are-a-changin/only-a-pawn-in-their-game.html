A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood<br />
A finger fired the trigger to his name<br />
A handle hid out in the dark<br />
A hand set the spark<br />
Two eyes took the aim<br />
Behind a man's brain<br />
But he can't be blamed<br />
He's only a pawn in their game.<br />
<br />
A South politician preaches to the poor white man<br />
"You got more than blacks, don't complain<br />
You're better than them, you been born with white skin" they explain<br />
And the Negro's name<br />
Is used it is plain<br />
For the politician's gain<br />
As he rises to fame<br />
And the poor white remains<br />
On the caboose of the train<br />
But it ain't him to blame<br />
He's only a pawn in their game.<br />
<br />
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid<br />
And the marshals and cops get the same<br />
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool<br />
He's taught in his school<br />
From the start by the rule<br />
That the laws are with him<br />
To protect his white skin<br />
<br>
To keep up his hate<br />
So he never thinks straight<br />
'Bout the shape that he's in<br />
But it ain't him to blame<br />
He's only a pawn in their game.<br />
<br />
From the powerty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks<br />
And the hoof beats pound in his brain<br />
And he's taught how to walk in a pack<br />
Shoot in the back<br />
With his fist in a clinch<br />
To hang and to lynch<br />
To hide 'neath the hood<br />
To kill with no pain<br />
Like a dog on a chain<br />
He ain't got no name<br />
But it ain't him to blame<br />
He's only a pawn in their game.<br />
<br />
Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught<br />
They lowered him down as a king<br />
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one<br />
That fired the gun<br />
He'll see by his grave<br />
On the stone that remains<br />
Carved next to his name<br />
His epitaph plain:<br />
Only a pawn in their game.</p>
