Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam <br />
And admit that the waters around you have grown <br />
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone <br />
If your time to you is worth savin' <br />
<br />
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone <br />
For the times they are a-changin' <br />
<br />
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen <br />
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again <br />
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin <br />
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin' <br />
<br />
For the loser now will be later to win <br />
For the times they are a-changin' <br />
<br />
Come senators, congressmen, please, heed the call <br />
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall <br />
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled <br />
<br>
There's a battle outside ragin' <br />
<br />
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls <br />
For the times they are a-changin' <br />
<br />
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land <br />
And don't criticize what you can't understand <br />
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command <br />
Your old road is rapidly agin' <br />
<br />
Please, get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand <br />
For the times they are a-changin' <br />
<br />
The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast <br />
The slow one now will later be fast <br />
As the present now will later be past <br />
The order is rapidly fadin' <br />
<br />
And the first one now will later be last <br />
For the times they are a-changin'</p>
