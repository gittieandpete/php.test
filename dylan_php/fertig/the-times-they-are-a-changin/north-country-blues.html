Come gather 'round friends<br />
And I'll tell you a tale<br />
Of when the red iron pits ran empty<br />
But the cardboard filled windows<br />
And old men on the benches<br />
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.<br />
<br />
In the north end of town<br />
My own children are grown<br />
But I was raised on the other<br />
In the wee hours of youth<br />
May mother took sick<br />
And I was brought up by my brother.<br />
<br />
The iron ore poured<br />
As the years passed the door<br />
The drag lines an' the shovels they was a-humming<br />
'Til one day my brother<br />
Failed to come home<br />
The same as my father before him.<br />
<br />
Well a long winter's wait<br />
From the window I watched<br />
My friends they couldn't have been kinder<br />
And my schooling was cut<br />
As I quit in the spring<br />
To marry John Thomas, a miner.<br />
<br />
Oh the years passed again<br />
And the givin' was good<br />
With the lunch bucket filled every season<br />
What with three babies born<br />
The work was cut down<br />
To a half a day's shift with no reason.<br />
<br>
Then the shaft was soon shut<br />
And more work was cut<br />
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen<br />
'Til a man come to speak<br />
And he said in one week<br />
That number eleven was closin'.<br />
<br />
They complained in the East<br />
They are playing too high<br />
They say that your ore ain't worth digging<br />
That it's much cheaper down<br />
In the South American towns<br />
Where the miners work almost for nothing.<br />
<br />
So the mining gates locked<br />
And the red iron rotted<br />
And the room smelted heavy from drinking<br />
Where the sad silent song<br />
Made the hour twice as long<br />
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.<br />
<br />
I lived by the window<br />
As he talked to himself<br />
This silence of tongues it was building<br />
Then one morning's wake<br />
The bed it was bare<br />
And I's left alone with three children.<br />
<br />
The summer is gone<br />
The ground's turning cold<br />
The stores one by one they're a-foldin'<br />
My children will go<br />
As soon they grow<br />
Well there ain't nothing here now to hold them.</p>
