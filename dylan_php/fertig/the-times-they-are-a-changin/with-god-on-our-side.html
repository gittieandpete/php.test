Oh my name it is nothin'<br />
My age it means less<br />
The country I come from<br />
Is called the Midwest<br />
I's taught and brought up there<br />
The laws to abide<br />
And the land that I live in<br />
Has God on its side.<br />
<br />
Oh the history books tell it<br />
They tell it so well<br />
The cavalries charged<br />
The Indians fell<br />
The cavalries charged<br />
The Indians died<br />
Oh the country was young<br />
With God on its side.<br />
<br />
The Spanish-American<br />
War had its day<br />
And the Civil War too<br />
Was soon laid away<br />
And the names of the heroes<br />
I's made to memorize<br />
With guns on their hands<br />
And God on their side.<br />
<br />
The First World War, boys<br />
It came and it went<br />
The reason for fighting<br />
I never did get<br />
But I learned to accept it<br />
Accept it with pride<br />
For you don't count the dead<br />
When God's on your side.<br />
<br />
When the Second World War<br />
Came to an end<br />
We forgave the Germans<br />
And then we were friends<br />
<br>
Though they murdered six million<br />
In the ovens they fried<br />
The Germans now too<br />
Have God on their side.<br />
<br />
I've learned to hate Russians<br />
All through my whole life<br />
If another war comes<br />
It's them we must fight<br />
To hate them and fear them<br />
To run and to hide<br />
And accept it all bravely<br />
With God on my side.<br />
<br />
But now we got weapons<br />
Of the chemical dust<br />
If fire them we're forced to<br />
Then fire them we must<br />
One push of the button<br />
And a shot the world wide<br />
And you never ask questions<br />
When God's on your side.<br />
<br />
In a many dark hour<br />
I've been thinkin' about this<br />
That Jesus Christ<br />
Was betrayed by a kiss<br />
But I can't think for you<br />
You'll have to decide<br />
Whether Judas Iscariot<br />
Had God on his side.<br />
<br />
So now as I'm leavin'<br />
I'm weary as Hell<br />
The confusion I'm feelin'<br />
Ain't no tongue can tell<br />
The words fill my head<br />
And fall to the floor<br />
If God's on our side<br />
He'll stop the next war.</p>
