Oh I'm sailin' away my own true love<br />
I'm sailin' away in the morning<br />
Is there something I can send you from across the sea<br />
From the place that I'll be landing ?<br />
<br />
No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love<br />
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'<br />
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled<br />
From across that lonesome ocean.<br />
<br />
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine<br />
Made of silver or of golden<br />
Either from the mountains of Madrid<br />
Or from the coast of Barcelona ?<br />
<br />
Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night<br />
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean<br />
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss<br />
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.<br />
<br />
That I might be gone a long time<br />
And it's only that I'm askin'<br />
<br>
Is there something I can send you to remember me by<br />
To make your time more easy passin' ?<br />
<br />
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again<br />
It only brings me sorrow<br />
The same thing I want from you today<br />
I would want again tomorrow.<br />
<br />
I got a letter on a lonesome day<br />
It was from her ship a-sailin'<br />
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again<br />
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.<br />
<br />
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way<br />
I'm sure your mind is roarmin'<br />
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me<br />
But with the country to where you're goin'.<br />
<br />
So take heed, take heed of the western wind<br />
Take heed of the stormy weather<br />
And yes, there's something you can send back to me<br />
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.</p>
