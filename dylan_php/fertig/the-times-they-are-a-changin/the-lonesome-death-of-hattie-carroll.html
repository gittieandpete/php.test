William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll<br />
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger<br />
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'<br />
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him<br />
As they rode him in custody down to the station<br />
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder<br />
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
Take the rag away from your face<br />
Now ain't the time for your tears.<br />
<br />
William Zanzinger who at twenty-four years<br />
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres<br />
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him<br />
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland<br />
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders<br />
And swear words and sneering and his tongue it was snarling<br />
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking<br />
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
Take the rag away from your face<br />
Now ain't the time for your tears.<br />
<br />
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen<br />
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children<br />
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage<br />
And never sat once at the head of the table<br />
<br>
And didn't even talk to the people at the table<br />
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table<br />
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level<br />
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane<br />
That sailed through the air and came down through the room<br />
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle<br />
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger<br />
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
Take the rag away from your face<br />
Now ain't the time for your tears.<br />
<br />
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel<br />
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level<br />
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded<br />
And that even the nobles get properly handled<br />
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em<br />
And that ladder of law has no top and no bottom<br />
Stared at the person who killed for no reason<br />
Who just happened to be feelin' that way witout warnin'<br />
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished<br />
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance<br />
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence<br />
Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fearsv<br />
Bury the rag deep in your face<br />
For now's the time for your tears.</p>
