Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br />
You threw the bums a dime in your prime<br />
Didn't you?<br />
People'd call, say: "Beware, doll, you're bound to fall"<br />
You thought they were all<br />
Kiddin' you<br />
<br />
You used to laugh about<br />
Everybody that was hanging out<br />
Now you don't talk so loud<br />
Now you don't seem so proud<br />
About having to be scrounging<br />
For your next meal<br />
<br />
How does it feel?<br />
How does it feel<br />
To be without a home<br />
Like a complete unknown<br />
Like a rolling stone?<br />
<br />
Oh, you've gone to the finest school, alright, miss lonely<br />
But you know you only used to get<br />
Juiced in it<br />
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street<br />
And now you're gonna have to get<br />
Used to it<br />
<br />
You say you'd never compromise<br />
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br />
He's not selling any alibis<br />
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br />
And say: "Do you want to<br />
Make a deal?"<br />
<br />
How does it feel?<br />
How does it feel<br />
To be on your own<br />
With no direction home<br />
A complete unknown<br />
Like a rolling stone?<br />
<br />
<br>
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns<br />
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did<br />
Tricks for you<br />
You never understood that it ain't no good<br />
You shouldn't let other people get your<br />
Kicks for you<br />
<br />
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat<br />
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat<br />
Ain't it hard when you discover that<br />
He really wasn't where it's at<br />
After he took from you everything<br />
He could steal?<br />
<br />
How does it feel?<br />
How does it feel<br />
To hang on your home<br />
With no direction home<br />
Like a complete unknown<br />
Like a rolling stone?<br />
<br />
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people<br />
They're all drinking thinking that they<br />
Got it made<br />
Exchanging all their precious gifts<br />
But you'd better take your diamond ring<br />
You'd better pawn it, baby<br />
<br />
You used to be so amused<br />
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br />
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse<br />
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br />
You're invisible now, you got no secrets<br />
To conceal<br />
<br />
How does it feel?<br />
How does it feel<br />
To be on your own<br />
With no direction home<br />
Like a complete unknown<br />
Like a rolling stone?</p>
