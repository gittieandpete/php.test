[Verse 1]<br />
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil<br />
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil<br />
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright<br />
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak<br />
<br>
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke<br />
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright<br />
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too<br />
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792<br />
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright<br />
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight</p>
