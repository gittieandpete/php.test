Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?<br />
Who's gonna let it roll ?<br />
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?<br />
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?<br />
<br />
Oh look, he's driving a long, long time<br />
There he still sits on top of the hill<br />
Well aching and jumping with all laid down<br />
With all of them ladies you know he's lonely still<br />
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?<br />
Who's gonna let it roll ?<br />
<br>
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?<br />
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?<br />
<br />
Well knee deep in number, heavy in toil<br />
Mighty mockingbird he still has such a heavy load<br />
Beneath his boundaries but more if I can tell<br />
With all of these travelling but I'm still on that road<br />
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?<br />
Who's gonna let it roll ?<br />
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?<br />
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?</p>
