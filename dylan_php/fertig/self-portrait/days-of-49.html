I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days<br />
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too, but what cares I for praise ?<br />
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign<br />
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49"<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How oft'times I repine for the days of old<br />
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.<br />
<br />
My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew<br />
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true<br />
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine<br />
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How oft'times I repine for the days of old<br />
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.<br />
<br />
There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight<br />
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight<br />
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein<br />
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How oft'times I repine for the days of old<br />
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.<br />
<br>
<br />
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game<br />
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same<br />
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind<br />
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How oft'times I repine for the days of old<br />
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.<br />
<br />
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget<br />
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet<br />
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design<br />
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How oft'times I repine for the days of old<br />
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.<br />
<br />
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast <br />
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost<br />
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign<br />
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 "<br />
In the days of old, in the days of gold<br />
How oft'times I repine for the days of old<br />
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.</p>
