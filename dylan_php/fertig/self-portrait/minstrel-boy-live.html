Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?<br />
Who's gonna let it roll?<br />
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?<br />
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?<br />
<br />
Oh, Lucky's been drivin' a long, long time<br />
And now he's stuck on top of the hill<br />
With twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb<br />
And with all of them ladies, though, he's lonely still<br />
<br />
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?<br />
Who's gonna let it roll?<br />
<br>
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?<br />
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?<br />
<br />
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil<br />
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load<br />
Beneath his boundaries, what more can I tell<br />
With all of his travelin', but I'm still on that road<br />
<br />
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?<br />
Who's gonna let it roll?<br />
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?<br />
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?</p>
