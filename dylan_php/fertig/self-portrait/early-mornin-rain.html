In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand<br />
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand<br />
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so<br />
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.<br />
<br />
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go<br />
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow<br />
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast<br />
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last.<br />
<br>
<br />
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high<br />
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly<br />
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines<br />
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time.<br />
<br />
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me<br />
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be<br />
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train<br />
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain.</p>
