Since you've been gone<br />
I've been walking around<br />
With my head bowed down to my shoes<br />
I've been living the blues every night without you.<br />
<br />
I don't have to go far<br />
To know where you are<br />
Strangers all give me the news<br />
I've been living the blues every night without you.<br />
<br />
I think that it's best<br />
I soon get some rest<br />
And forget my pride, but I can't deny<br />
This feeling that I carry for you deep down inside.<br />
<br>
<br />
If you'd see me this way<br />
You'd come back and you'd stay<br />
Oh, how could you refuse ?<br />
I've been living the blues every night without you.<br />
<br />
I think that it's best<br />
I soon get some rest<br />
And forget my pride, but I can't deny<br />
This feeling that I carry for you deep down inside.<br />
<br />
If you'd see me this way<br />
You'd come back and you'd stay<br />
Oh, how could you refuse ?<br />
I've been living the blues every night without you.</p>
