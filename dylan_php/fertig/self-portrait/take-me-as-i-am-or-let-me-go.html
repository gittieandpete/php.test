[Verse 1]<br />
Why must you always try to make me over ?<br />
Take me as I am or let me go<br />
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover<br />
Take me as I am or let me go<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
You're trying to reshape me in a moment<br />
In the image of someone you used to know<br />
I won't be a stand-in for an old love<br />
Take me as I am or let me go<br />
<br>
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me<br />
Take me as I am or let me go<br />
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me<br />
Take me as I am or let me go<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
You're trying to reshape me in a mould love<br />
In the image of someone you used to know<br />
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love<br />
Take me as I am or let me go</p>
