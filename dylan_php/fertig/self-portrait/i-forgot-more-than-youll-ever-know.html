I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.<br />
<br />
You think you know the smile on her lips<br />
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips<br />
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.<br />
<br />
You think you'll find heaven of bliss<br />
In each caress, in each tender kiss<br />
<br>
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.<br />
<br />
You stole her love from me one day<br />
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me<br />
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.<br />
<br />
You think she's yours, to have and to hold<br />
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold<br />
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.</p>
