Went out last night just to take a little round<br />
I get my little Sadie and I brought her down<br />
I run right home and I went to bed<br />
With a forty-four smokeless under my head.<br />
<br />
Went out last night just to take a little round<br />
I get my little Sadie and I brought her down<br />
I run right home and I went to bed<br />
With a forty-four smokeless under my head.<br />
<br />
I begin to think of what a deed I'd done<br />
I grabbed my hat and I began to run<br />
I made a good run but I ran too slow<br />
They overtake me down in Jericho.<br />
<br />
Standing on a corner as he's ringing my bell<br />
Up stepped the sherrif of Thomasville<br />
<br>
He said, "Young man, is you name Brown ?<br />
Remember you blowed little Sadie down ?".<br />
<br />
"Oh yes sir, my name is Lee<br />
I murdered little Sadie in first degree"<br />
"First degree and second degree<br />
If you've got any papers, will you serve 'em to me ?".<br />
<br />
Well they took me downtown and they dressed me in black<br />
They put me on a train and they sent me back<br />
I had no one for to go my bail<br />
They crammed me back into the crowded jail<br />
<br />
Well, the judge and the jury they took their stand<br />
The judge had the papers in his right hand<br />
Forty-one days, forty-one nights, forty-one years<br />
To wear the ball and the stripes</p>
