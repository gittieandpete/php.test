These are the words of a frontier man<br />
Who lost his love when he turned bad.<br />
<br />
Take a message to Mary<br />
But don't tell here where I am<br />
Take a message to Mary<br />
But don't say I'm in a jam<br />
You can tell her that I had to see the world<br />
Tell her that my ship set sail<br />
You can say she'd better not wait for me<br />
But don't tell her I'm in jail, oh don't tell her I'm in jail.<br />
<br />
Take a message to Mary<br />
But don't tell her what I've done<br />
<br>
Please, don't mention the stage coach<br />
And the shot from a carried gun<br />
You better tell her that I had to change my plans<br />
And cancel out the wedding-day<br />
But please, don't mention the lonely cell<br />
Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day.<br />
<br />
Take a message to Mary<br />
But don't tell her all you know<br />
My heart is aching for Mary<br />
Lord know I miss her so<br />
Just tell her that I went to Timbukto<br />
Tell her I'm searching for gold<br />
You can say she better find someone new<br />
To cherish and to hold, oh Lord, this cell is so cold.</p>
