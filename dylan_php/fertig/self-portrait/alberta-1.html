Alberta, let your hair hang low, Alberta, let your hair hang low<br />
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold<br />
If you'll only let your hair hang low.<br />
<br />
Alberta, what's on your mind, Alberta, what's on your mind ?<br />
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time<br />
Alberta, what's on your mind ?<br />
<br>
<br />
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind, Alberta, don't you treat me unkind ?<br />
Oh my heart is sad because I want you so bad<br />
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind ?<br />
<br />
Alberta, let your hair hang low, Alberta, let your hair hang low <br />
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold<br />
If you'll only let your hair hang low.</p>
