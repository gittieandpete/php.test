As Vasil Toshkov stated, password_verify() can be used to verify a password created by crypt() or password_hash()

That is because passwords created by password_hash() also use the C crypt sheme

If you want to verify older plain MD5-Hashes you just need to prefix them with $1$

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C) for more information.
